    wrong: "Enabling ProcessSignal and expecting audio to pass through unchanged"
    right: "Leave ProcessSignal Off for analysis-only mode. Enable it only when the envelope signal itself is the desired output."
    explanation: "When ProcessSignal is On, all audio channels are replaced with the envelope value. This produces a DC-like signal following the input amplitude, not usable as audio output."

  dynamics.envelope_follower

  Polyphonic envelope follower that tracks the peak amplitude of the input signal. Each voice maintains its own envelope state. Outputs the tracked envelope as a normalised modulation signal (0..1).

  Signal flow:
    audio in -> peak detect -> attack/release follower -> modulation out (envelope 0..1)
    if ProcessSignal=On: audio replaced with envelope value

  CPU: low, polyphonic (scales linearly with voice count)

  Parameters:
    Attack: 0 - 1000 ms (default 20). Envelope attack time.
    Release: 0 - 1000 ms (default 20). Envelope release time.
    ProcessSignal: Off / On (default Off). Off = pass audio through; On = replace audio with envelope.

  When to use:
    Tracking input amplitude for modulation routing. Commonly paired with math.mul or core.gain for sidechain-style ducking or level-dependent effects. Use dynamics.comp/gate/limiter when gain reduction is needed directly.

  Common mistakes:
    ProcessSignal On replaces audio with envelope DC signal.

A polyphonic envelope follower that tracks the peak amplitude of the input signal. Each voice maintains its own envelope state with independent attack and release smoothing. The tracked envelope is output as a normalised modulation signal (0..1), which can be routed to other parameters for amplitude-dependent processing such as ducking, auto-gain, or visual metering.

By default, audio passes through the node unchanged while the envelope is tracked in the background. Enabling ProcessSignal replaces the audio output with the envelope value itself.

## Notes

This is the only polyphonic node in the dynamics factory. Each voice tracks its own envelope independently, making it suitable for per-voice amplitude modulation in synthesiser patches.

The envelope follower uses peak detection (not RMS), taking the maximum absolute sample value across all channels per frame. For RMS-based detection, use [dynamics.updown_comp]($SN.dynamics.updown_comp$) with its RMS toggle.

The attack and release range (0-1000 ms) is wider than [dynamics.comp]($SN.dynamics.comp$), [dynamics.gate]($SN.dynamics.gate$), and [dynamics.limiter]($SN.dynamics.limiter$) (0-250 ms), allowing slower envelope shapes for gentle amplitude tracking.
