  control.clone_cable

  Distributes different values to each clone in a container.clone using a selectable distribution algorithm. Nine modes available: Spread, Scale, Triangle, Harmonics, Nyquist, Fixed, Ducker, Random, Toggle. Some modes respond to MIDI note-on frequency.

  Signal flow:
    Control node - no audio processing
    Value + Gamma -> mode algorithm -> per-clone output (normalised)

  CPU: negligible, monophonic

  Parameters:
    NumClones: 1 - 16 (integer, default 1)
      Auto-synced from the parent clone container.
    Value: 0.0 - 1.0 (default 0.0)
      Input value for the distribution function. Replaced by note frequency for MIDI-reactive modes.
    Gamma: 0.0 - 1.0 (default 0.0)
      Shape modifier. Effect varies by mode; ignored by Harmonics, Fixed, Random, Toggle.

  When to use:
    Per-clone parameter differentiation in a clone container: detuning, harmonic series, spatial spread, random variation, volume ducking.

  Common mistakes:
    MIDI-reactive modes need a MIDI context to receive note-on events.
    Frequency targets need the linear 0-20kHz range preset.

The clone cable distributes different values to each clone inside a [container.clone]($SN.container.clone$). A Mode property selects the distribution algorithm, and the Value parameter controls the overall intensity of the distribution. The Gamma parameter adjusts the distribution curve shape for modes that support it.

Nine distribution modes are available:

| Mode | Description | Gamma effect | MIDI-reactive |
|------|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| Spread | Bipolar spread from the centre point | Blends linear to sine curve | No |
| Scale | Unipolar ramp from zero to Value | Power curve exponent | No |
| Triangle | V-shape peak at centre, dips at edges | Blends linear to sine-squared curve | No |
| Harmonics | Integer multiples of the input value | Ignored | Yes |
| Nyquist | Harmonic series with high-frequency rolloff | Rolloff steepness | Yes |
| Fixed | Same value to all clones | Ignored | Yes |
| Ducker | Gain compensation based on clone count | Reduces ducking amount | No |
| Random | Random offset around a spread-like base | Ignored | No |
| Toggle | Binary on/off threshold across clones | Ignored | No |

The Harmonics, Nyquist, and Fixed modes respond to MIDI note-on events. When a note-on is received, the note frequency replaces the Value parameter as the distribution input. This makes them suitable for additive synthesis, where each clone produces a different harmonic of the played note. The Random mode also re-randomises on note-on but does not use the frequency.

## Notes

- The NumClones parameter is automatically kept in sync with the parent clone container. Manual adjustment is possible but will be overwritten when the container's clone count changes.
- Toggle mode is an exception: it does not auto-update when the clone count changes.
- Output values are normalised (0-1), so target parameter ranges are applied automatically.
- For MIDI-reactive modes, connect the target parameter using the linear 0-20kHz range preset if it represents a frequency.
