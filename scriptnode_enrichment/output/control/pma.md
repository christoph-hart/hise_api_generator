  control.pma

  Scales and offsets a normalised modulation signal. Computes Value * Multiply + Add, clamped to 0-1. PMA stands for Parameter Multiply Add.

  Signal flow:
    Control node - no audio processing
    Value (0..1) -> * Multiply -> + Add -> clamp(0, 1) -> modulation out

  CPU: negligible, polyphonic

  Parameters:
    Value (0.0 - 1.0, default 0.0): input signal, typically connected to a modulation source
    Multiply (-1.0 - 1.0, default 1.0): scale factor
    Add (-1.0 - 1.0, default 0.0): constant offset applied after multiplication

  When to use:
    Commonly used (rank 35, 11 instances). Use when you need to scale or offset a normalised modulation signal before it reaches its target. Typical uses include controlling modulation intensity, inverting a signal (Multiply = -1), or adding a constant baseline.

  Common mistakes:
    Output is clamped to 0-1 -- use pma_unscaled for unclamped output.

The PMA node (Parameter Multiply Add) scales and offsets a normalised modulation signal. It takes a 0-1 input value, multiplies it by a configurable factor, adds a constant offset, and clamps the result to the 0-1 range. This is one of the most commonly used control nodes for adjusting modulation depth, inverting signals, or combining parameters.

Each parameter change triggers an independent output update. If Value, Multiply, and Add all change in sequence, three separate output values are sent to connected targets.

## Notes

The output is always clamped to the 0-1 range regardless of the Multiply and Add values. If you need the result to exceed this range (for example when working with frequency or pitch values), use [control.pma_unscaled]($SN.control.pma_unscaled$) instead.

With the default settings (Multiply = 1.0, Add = 0.0), the node passes the input value through unchanged.
