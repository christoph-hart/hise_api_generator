  control.sliderbank

  Multiplies an input value by each element of a slider pack and sends the scaled results to up to 8 separate output targets.

  Signal flow:
    Control node - no audio processing
    Value * sliderPack[i] -> output[i] for each connected target

  CPU: negligible, monophonic

  Parameters:
    Value (0.0 - 1.0, default 0.0): Input value multiplied by each slider pack element

  Properties:
    NumParameters: Number of output slots (max 8)

  When to use:
    Use when a single control value needs to drive multiple parameters at different intensities, such as distributing a macro knob to several targets with individual scaling.

Slider Bank multiplies a single input value by each element of a slider pack and sends the result to a separate output for each element. This makes it straightforward to distribute one control signal to multiple targets, each with its own scaling factor defined by the corresponding slider in the pack.

The node supports up to 8 outputs. When an individual slider in the pack changes, only the corresponding output is updated rather than recalculating all outputs.

## Notes

The NumParameters property controls how many output slots are available. The slider pack is automatically resized to match this count. Each output can be connected to a different target parameter, allowing a single knob to control multiple destinations with individual scaling.
