  control.midi

  Converts MIDI events into a normalised 0..1 modulation signal. The Mode property selects which MIDI data to extract.

  Signal flow:
    MIDI event -> convert to 0..1 based on Mode -> normalised modulation output

  CPU: negligible, monophonic

  Properties:
    Mode: Gate | Velocity | NoteNumber | Frequency | Random

  Modes:
    Gate: 1.0 on note-on, 0.0 on note-off
    Velocity: note-on velocity / 127
    NoteNumber: note number / 127
    Frequency: note frequency / 20000
    Random: random 0..1 on each note-on

  When to use:
    Driving scriptnode parameters from MIDI input. 9 instances across surveyed projects (rank 43). Common for velocity-sensitive effects, key-tracking filters, or gate-triggered envelopes.

Converts incoming MIDI note events into a normalised modulation signal (0..1). The Mode property determines which aspect of the MIDI data is extracted and how it maps to the output value. All modes produce normalised output suitable for driving any parameter via modulation connections.

The available modes are:

- **Gate** -- outputs 1.0 on note-on and 0.0 on note-off
- **Velocity** -- outputs the note-on velocity divided by 127
- **NoteNumber** -- outputs the note number (including transposition) divided by 127
- **Frequency** -- outputs the note frequency divided by 20000
- **Random** -- outputs a random value between 0.0 and 1.0 on each note-on

## Notes

This node appears in 9 networks across the surveyed projects (rank 43), making it one of the more commonly used MIDI-to-modulation converters. Typical uses include velocity-sensitive effect parameters, key-tracking filter cutoffs, and gate signals for envelopes.

The node does not process audio -- it only responds to MIDI events. However, it must be placed inside the signal path so that the event processing system can deliver MIDI events to it. The output only updates when a relevant MIDI event is received.
