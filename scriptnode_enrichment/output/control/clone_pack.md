  control.clone_pack

  Sends per-clone values from a slider pack, each multiplied by a global Value parameter. Each slider index maps to the corresponding clone index.

  Signal flow:
    Control node - no audio processing
    sliderPack[i] * Value -> per-clone output (normalised)

  CPU: negligible, monophonic

  Parameters:
    NumClones: 1 - 16 (integer, default 1)
      Auto-synced from the parent clone container.
    Value: 0.0 - 1.0 (default 1.0)
      Global multiplier applied to all slider pack values.

  When to use:
    Arbitrary per-clone parameter control where each clone needs an explicitly set value - e.g. custom detuning curves, per-voice gain patterns, or any parameter distribution that does not fit a mathematical formula.

  Common mistakes:
    Slider pack size must match clone count. Extra clones receive no update.

  See also:
    [alternative] control.clone_cable -- formula-based distribution
    [alternative] control.clone_forward -- same value to all clones
    [companion] control.pack_resizer -- dynamically resizes the slider pack
    [companion] container.clone -- the clone container this node controls
---

The clone pack node sends individually specified values to each clone in a [container.clone]($SN.container.clone$). Each slider in the connected slider pack maps to the corresponding clone index. The Value parameter acts as a global multiplier applied to all slider values before they are sent.

This provides fully arbitrary per-clone control, unlike [control.clone_cable]($SN.control.clone_cable$) which uses mathematical distribution formulas. It is ideal for cases where each clone needs a hand-crafted or script-driven value that does not follow a regular pattern.

Editing a single slider in the pack updates only the corresponding clone, not all clones. This makes it efficient for real-time slider pack manipulation.

## Notes

- The slider pack is not automatically resized when the clone count changes. Use [control.pack_resizer]($SN.control.pack_resizer$) if you need dynamic resizing, or set the pack size manually to match the maximum clone count.
- If the slider pack has fewer entries than the active clone count, extra clones are not updated.
- If the slider pack has more entries than clones, extra entries are ignored.
- Output values are normalised (0-1), so target parameter ranges are applied automatically.
