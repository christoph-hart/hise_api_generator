  control.locked_mod

  Adds a normalised modulation dragger to the parent container when locked. Passes the Value parameter (0..1) through to the container's modulation output with target range conversion applied.

  Signal flow:
    Control node -- no audio processing
    Value (0..1) -> passthrough -> normalised modulation output on locked container

  CPU: negligible, monophonic

  Parameters:
    Value: 0.0 - 1.0 (default 0.0). The normalised value sent to the container's modulation output.

  When to use:
    Turning a container into a reusable modulation source. Connect any internal signal to Value, lock the container, and drag the modulation output to targets elsewhere in the network. Not observed in the surveyed projects.

Turns a locked container into a modulation source by forwarding the Value parameter to the container's modulation output. When this node is placed as an immediate child of a container and the container is locked (via the lock icon in the toolbar), a modulation dragger appears on the locked container that can be connected to any target in the network.

The output is normalised: the connection system applies the target parameter's range to convert the 0..1 value appropriately. Connect any internal modulation source to the Value parameter to expose it on the parent container.

## Notes

To use this node:

1. Add it as an immediate child of a container
2. Connect its Value parameter to any modulation source inside the container
3. Lock the container using the lock icon in the toolbar

The locked container then shows a modulation dragger that can be connected to targets outside the container. This is useful for creating reusable modulation building blocks.
