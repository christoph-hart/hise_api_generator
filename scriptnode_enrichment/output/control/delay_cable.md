  control.delay_cable

  Delays a control value by a configurable number of samples before forwarding it. Only one value can be in flight at a time; new values reset the counter.

  Signal flow:
    Control node -- requires audio processing for sample counting
    Value in -> store + reset counter -> count samples in process() -> when elapsed, forward to modulation output

  CPU: negligible, polyphonic

  Parameters:
    Value: 0.0 - 1.0 (default 0.0). The value to delay. Unnormalised -- the raw value is forwarded.
    DelayTimeSamples: 0 - 44100 samples (default 0.0). Number of samples to wait before forwarding.

  When to use:
    When a control signal needs to arrive later than its source fires -- for example, staggering parameter changes or introducing timing offsets in modulation routing. Not observed in the surveyed projects, suggesting it is a specialised utility.

    [alternative] control.smoothed_parameter -- smooths rather than delays
---

Delays a control value by a specified number of samples before forwarding it to the modulation output. When Value changes, the node stores the new value and begins counting samples during audio processing. Once the count reaches the DelayTimeSamples threshold, the stored value is sent to the output.

Unlike most control nodes, delay_cable participates in audio processing because it needs to count samples. Only one value can be queued at a time -- setting Value again while waiting replaces the queued value and restarts the counter.

## Notes

The delay is measured in raw samples, not milliseconds. At 44100 Hz, the maximum delay of 44100 samples equals one second. Modulating DelayTimeSamples in real time is supported: shortening it below the current counter causes immediate output on the next process call, while lengthening it extends the wait.
