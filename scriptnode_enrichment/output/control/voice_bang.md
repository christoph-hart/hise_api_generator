  control.voice_bang

  Sends the current Value parameter as a modulation signal each time a note-on message is received. Acts as a per-voice trigger that re-sends its stored value on every new note.

  Signal flow:
    Control node - no audio processing
    Note-on event -> send stored Value -> normalised modulation output

  CPU: negligible, monophonic (shared value, but requires polyphonic context)

  Parameters:
    Value (0.0 - 1.0, default 0.0): The value sent to the output on each note-on

  When to use:
    Use to create a static per-voice control signal that is set once at note start. Useful for randomised parameters (when driven by a random source) or for latching a value at voice onset.

  Common mistakes:
    Using outside a polyphonic container -- requires polyphonic context

Voice Bang sends its stored Value to the modulation output each time a note-on message is received. The Value parameter acts as the payload: whatever value is set when a note arrives is what gets sent. This makes it useful for latching a control value at voice onset, such as capturing a randomised parameter or a UI control state at the moment a note begins.

The node must be placed inside a polyphonic container. All voices share the same stored Value, but each voice's note-on independently triggers the output. Changing the Value between notes affects what subsequent voices receive.

## Notes

Unlike [control.bang]($SN.control.bang$), which triggers when its input parameter changes, voice_bang triggers on MIDI note-on events. This distinction is important: bang responds to parameter automation, while voice_bang responds to musical input.

A common pattern is to connect a [control.random]($SN.control.random$) node to the Value input, producing a different random value for each new voice.
