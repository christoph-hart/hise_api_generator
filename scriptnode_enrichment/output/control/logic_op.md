  control.logic_op

  Combines two binary input signals using a selectable logic operator. Inputs are converted to boolean via a > 0.5 threshold. Output is strictly 1.0 or 0.0.

  Signal flow:
    Control node - no audio processing
    Left (> 0.5 = true) + Right (> 0.5 = true) -> Operator (AND/OR/XOR) -> modulation out (1.0 or 0.0)

  CPU: negligible, polyphonic

  Parameters:
    Left (0.0 - 1.0, default 0.0): first logic input, thresholded at 0.5
    Right (0.0 - 1.0, default 0.0): second logic input, thresholded at 0.5
    Operator (AND/OR/XOR, default AND): logic operation

  When to use:
    Use for combining binary conditions in control networks. Feed the outputs of compare nodes or toggle switches into Left and Right to create compound conditions.

  Common mistakes:
    No output until both inputs have received a value after reset.

Combines two binary input signals using a selectable logic operator and outputs 1.0 (true) or 0.0 (false). Each input is converted to a boolean value using a threshold: values above 0.5 are treated as true, values at or below 0.5 as false.

The three available operators are AND (both must be true), OR (at least one must be true), and XOR (exactly one must be true). This node is typically used to combine the binary outputs of [control.compare]($SN.control.compare$) nodes or toggle switches to create compound conditions in a control network.

## Notes

After a voice reset, both inputs are in an undefined state. The node waits until both Left and Right have each received at least one value before producing any output. This prevents spurious results when only one input has been initialised.

Changes to either input or to the Operator selection trigger a new output evaluation, provided both inputs have been defined.
