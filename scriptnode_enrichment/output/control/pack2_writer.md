  control.pack2_writer

  Writes two individual parameter values into a connected slider pack. Each Value parameter maps directly to a slider pack index. The node has no modulation output - it writes to the slider pack's complex data.

  Signal flow:
    Control node - no audio processing
    Value1 -> sliderPack[0]
    Value2 -> sliderPack[1]

  CPU: negligible, monophonic

  Parameters:
    Value1: 0.0 - 1.0 (default 0.0) -> writes to slider pack index 0
    Value2: 0.0 - 1.0 (default 0.0) -> writes to slider pack index 1

  When to use:
    Populating a 2-element slider pack from individual parameter connections or modulation sources. Useful when each slider value needs to come from a different source.

  Common mistakes:
    Connected slider pack is auto-resized to 2 entries.

The pack2_writer writes two individual parameter values into a connected slider pack. Each Value parameter maps directly to the corresponding slider index: Value1 writes to index 0, Value2 writes to index 1. The node has no modulation output - it writes directly to the slider pack data.

This is useful when you need to populate a slider pack from separate modulation sources or parameter connections, rather than editing slider values manually. Each parameter can be independently modulated, allowing dynamic control of individual slider entries.

When connected to a slider pack, the pack is automatically resized to 2 entries to match the number of Value parameters. For more entries, use a higher variant such as [control.pack3_writer]($SN.control.pack3_writer$) through [control.pack8_writer]($SN.control.pack8_writer$).

## Notes

- The node has no modulation output. It writes to complex data (the slider pack), not to parameter targets.
- UI updates for the slider pack display are asynchronous.
- Variants from [control.pack3_writer]($SN.control.pack3_writer$) to [control.pack8_writer]($SN.control.pack8_writer$) provide the same functionality with 3 to 8 Value parameters respectively.
