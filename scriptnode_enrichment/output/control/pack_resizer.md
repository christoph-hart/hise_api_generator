  control.pack_resizer

  Dynamically resizes a connected slider pack to the specified number of entries. Existing values are preserved when the pack grows; entries are truncated when it shrinks.

  Signal flow:
    Control node - no audio processing
    NumSliders -> resize slider pack

  CPU: negligible, monophonic

  Parameters:
    NumSliders: 0 - 128 (integer, default 0, effective minimum 1)
      Number of entries in the slider pack. Values below 1 are clamped to 1.

  When to use:
    Making a slider pack's size controllable at runtime, e.g. matching the number of active clones, frequency bands, or steps in a sequencer.

  Common mistakes:
    Avoid audio-rate modulation of NumSliders - resizing involves memory allocation.

The pack resizer dynamically changes the number of entries in a connected slider pack. When the pack grows, existing values are preserved and new entries receive default values. When it shrinks, entries beyond the new size are removed.

The NumSliders parameter accepts values from 0 to 128, but values below 1 are clamped to 1 - the slider pack always has at least one entry. This node has no modulation output; it modifies the slider pack's dimensions directly.

## Notes

- Unlike the pack writer nodes, pack_resizer does not auto-resize the slider pack when first connected. It only resizes when the NumSliders parameter changes.
- Resizing involves memory allocation, so avoid driving NumSliders from audio-rate sources. UI controls and low-rate control nodes are appropriate sources.
