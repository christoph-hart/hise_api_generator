  envelope.global_mod_gate

  Monitors a global modulator and outputs a binary gate: 1.0 while the modulator's envelope is active for the current voice, 0.0 when it has been released. Does not process audio.

  Signal flow:
    Control node - no audio processing
    GlobalModulatorContainer[Index] -> per-voice active check -> Gate output (0 or 1)

  CPU: negligible, polyphonic

  Parameters:
    Index (0-16, step 1, default 1; selects the global modulator slot to monitor)

  When to use:
    Voice lifecycle management driven by a global envelope modulator. Connect the gate output to envelope.voice_manager.

Monitors a global modulator from the GlobalModulatorContainer and outputs a binary gate signal: 1.0 while the modulator's envelope is active for the current voice, 0.0 when the voice has been released. The node does not modify audio; it connects to the HISE module tree via a runtime target and reads the per-voice envelope state.

This is the gate companion to [core.global_mod]($SN.core.global_mod$), which provides the continuous envelope value. Use global_mod_gate when you need to know whether a voice is still active according to a global envelope, typically for connecting to an [envelope.voice_manager]($SN.envelope.voice_manager$) node.

## Notes

- The node must be connected to a GlobalModulatorContainer via the runtime target system. Without a valid connection, the gate always reads as active.
- The gate output is strictly binary (0 or 1). There are no intermediate values.
- For non-envelope modulators (such as voice-start or time-variant types), the gate always returns 1 because these modulator types do not have per-voice release states.
- Each voice independently tracks its own gate state based on the corresponding voice of the global modulator.
