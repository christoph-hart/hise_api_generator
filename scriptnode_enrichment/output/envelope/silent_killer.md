    explanation: "The per-block silence check uses its own hardcoded threshold. The Threshold parameter exists in the interface but does not influence the detection."
  - title: "Silence during note-on does not kill the voice"
    wrong: "Expecting the voice to be killed during brief silent passages while the note is held (e.g. from an LFO modulating amplitude to zero)."
    right: "The node only triggers a voice reset after a note-off has been received AND the audio is silent."
    explanation: "The node tracks note-on/off state internally. Silence detection only fires after note-off to avoid false kills during intentional momentary silences."

  envelope.silent_killer

  Monitors the audio signal for silence and sends a voice reset message when the signal is silent after note-off. Audio passes through unmodified.

  Signal flow:
    audio in -> silence check -> audio out (passthrough)
    if silent and note-off received -> voice reset

  CPU: negligible, polyphonic

  Parameters:
    Threshold (-120 to -60 dB, default -100; stored but not used by the detection)
    Active (Off/On, default On; disables silence detection when Off)

  When to use:
    Fallback voice cleanup when the signal path makes it difficult to derive a clean gate signal. Prefer envelope.voice_manager with an explicit envelope gate for predictable behaviour.

---

Monitors the audio signal and sends a voice reset message when silence is detected after a note-off event. The audio passes through completely unmodified. This provides automatic voice cleanup as a fallback when you cannot easily derive a clean gate signal from an envelope.

The node checks for silence on a per-block basis and only triggers when three conditions are met: the Active parameter is enabled, the voice has received a note-off, and the audio block is silent. The note-off requirement prevents false kills during intentional momentary silences (for example, from an LFO modulating amplitude to zero).

## Notes

- The audio signal passes through completely unchanged. The node only reads the audio data to check for silence; it never modifies it.
- The voice reset is immediate, with no fade-out. Since the audio is already silent when the reset fires, no click occurs.
- This approach is less predictable than using an explicit envelope gate with [envelope.voice_manager]($SN.envelope.voice_manager$). Use silent_killer as a safety net or when the signal path makes gate-based management impractical.
