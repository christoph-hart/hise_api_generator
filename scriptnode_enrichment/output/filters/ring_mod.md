  filters.ring_mod

  Ring modulator that multiplies the input by an internal sine oscillator. Q controls wet/dry mix, not resonance. Placed in the filters factory for architectural reasons but is functionally an effect.

  Signal flow:
    audio in -> multiply by sine oscillator -> wet/dry mix -> audio out

  CPU: low, polyphonic

  Parameters:
    Frequency: 20 - 20000 Hz (default 1000). Internal sine oscillator frequency.
    Q: 0.3 - 9.9 (default 1.0). Modulation depth (0 = dry, max = full ring mod).
    Gain: -18 - 18 dB (default 0). Ignored.
    Smoothing: 0 - 1 s (default 0.01). Parameter interpolation time.
    Mode: RingMod only (default RingMod).
    Enabled: Off / On (default On). Hard bypass.

  When to use:
    Ring modulation effects. Creates inharmonic sum and difference frequencies. Minimum oscillator frequency is 20 Hz, so true tremolo is not achievable.

  Common mistakes:
    Q controls wet/dry mix, not resonance.

A ring modulator that multiplies the input signal by an internal sine oscillator. This produces inharmonic sum and difference frequencies characteristic of ring modulation. Despite being in the filters factory, this is an effect node - it shares the standard filter parameter interface but repurposes Frequency for the oscillator and Q for modulation depth.

At minimum Q (0.3), the output is the unmodified dry signal. At maximum Q (9.9), the output is fully ring-modulated. Intermediate values crossfade between dry and modulated signal.

## Notes

The oscillator phase is shared across all channels but is not reset on note-on. In a polyphonic context, different voices may have different modulation phases depending on when they started.

The minimum oscillator frequency is 20 Hz. For tremolo effects at lower rates, use a [control.pma]($SN.control.pma$) with an external LFO modulating a [core.gain]($SN.core.gain$) node instead.
