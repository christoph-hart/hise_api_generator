  Fourth-order Linkwitz-Riley (LR4) crossover filter with 24 dB/oct slope. Computes both LP and HP internally, outputs one based on Mode. LP + HP sum to flat allpass (unity gain at crossover).

  Signal flow:
    audio in -> LR4 filter (both LP and HP computed) -> selected output

  CPU: low, polyphonic

  Parameters:
    Frequency: 20 - 20000 Hz (default 1000). Crossover frequency.
    Q: 0.3 - 9.9 (default 1.0). Ignored - LR filters have fixed Q.
    Gain: -18 - 18 dB (default 0). Ignored.
    Smoothing: 0 - 1 s (default 0.01). Parameter interpolation time.
    Mode: LP, HP, AP (default LP). AP = LP + HP sum (flat).
    Enabled: Off / On (default On). Hard bypass.

  When to use:
    Frequency-band splitting for multiband processing. Use two instances at the same frequency for a proper crossover. The LP and HP outputs sum to unity gain at the crossover point with no amplitude colouring.

  Common mistakes:
    Use two nodes for a crossover - one LP, one HP. A single node only outputs one band.

A fourth-order Linkwitz-Riley (LR4) crossover filter with a 24 dB/octave slope. It computes both lowpass and highpass paths internally and selects the output based on the Mode parameter. When two instances are set to the same frequency - one in LP mode and one in HP mode - their outputs sum to the original signal with only phase shift and no amplitude colouring at the crossover point.

The Q and Gain parameters are ignored. Linkwitz-Riley filters have a fixed Q by design.

## Notes

Both the LP and HP processing paths run regardless of Mode, so AP mode has no additional CPU cost over LP or HP alone.

To build a two-band crossover, place two linkwitzriley nodes in a [container.split]($SN.container.split$) with matching Frequency values. The first node in LP mode provides the low band; the second in HP mode provides the high band.
