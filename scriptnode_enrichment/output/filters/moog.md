  filters.moog

  Moog-style transistor ladder lowpass filter with 24 dB/oct slope. Analog-modelled with resonance feedback that can approach self-oscillation at high Q. Always processes as 4-pole regardless of Mode setting.

  Signal flow:
    audio in -> 4-stage ladder with feedback -> audio out

  CPU: low, polyphonic

  Parameters:
    Frequency: 20 - 20000 Hz (default 1000). Cutoff frequency.
    Q: 0.3 - 9.9 (default 1.0). Resonance feedback. High values approach self-oscillation.
    Gain: -18 - 18 dB (default 0). Ignored.
    Smoothing: 0 - 1 s (default 0.01). Parameter interpolation time.
    Mode: One Pole, Two Poles, Four Poles (default One Pole). Display only - does not affect processing.
    Enabled: Off / On (default On). Hard bypass.

  When to use:
    Classic analog-style lowpass with character. Choose over filters.ladder when a warmer, more coloured sound is desired. Not suited for EQ or multimode filtering.

  Common mistakes:
    Mode parameter is display-only - processing is always 24 dB/oct regardless of Mode setting.

A Moog-style transistor ladder lowpass filter with a 24 dB/octave slope. The analog-modelled design includes input history mixing and specific scaling constants that give it a warmer, more coloured character than the simpler [filters.ladder]($SN.filters.ladder$).

The Q parameter drives resonance feedback that can approach self-oscillation at high values. This filter is always a 4-pole lowpass regardless of the Mode setting.

## Notes

The Mode parameter is misleading - it only changes the filter display curve, not the processing. Audio always passes through all four ladder stages (24 dB/oct).

For a lighter ladder lowpass without the analog-modelling character, use [filters.ladder]($SN.filters.ladder$). For a multimode filter with LP/HP/BP options, use [filters.svf]($SN.filters.svf$) instead.
