  filters.biquad

  Second-order biquad (IIR) filter with six modes: LowPass, HighPass, LowShelf, HighShelf, Peak, and ResoLow. Uses standard cookbook formulas.

  Signal flow:
    audio in -> biquad filter -> audio out

  CPU: low, polyphonic

  Parameters:
    Frequency: 20 - 20000 Hz (default 1000). Cutoff or centre frequency.
    Q: 0.3 - 9.9 (default 1.0). Used by LowShelf, HighShelf, Peak, ResoLow. Ignored by LowPass, HighPass.
    Gain: -18 - 18 dB (default 0). Used by LowShelf, HighShelf, Peak. Ignored by LowPass, HighPass, ResoLow.
    Smoothing: 0 - 1 s (default 0.01). Coefficient interpolation time.
    Mode: LowPass, HighPass, LowShelf, HighShelf, Peak, ResoLow (default LowPass).
    Enabled: Off / On (default On). Hard bypass.

  When to use:
    Static or slowly changing EQ. Has the widest mode selection of any filter node (6 modes). Avoid for fast modulation - use SVF filters instead.

  Common mistakes:
    LowPass mode has no resonance. Use ResoLow for resonant lowpass.
    Susceptible to clicks with fast modulation. Use SVF filters for filter sweeps.

A second-order biquad filter with six modes: LowPass, HighPass, LowShelf, HighShelf, Peak, and ResoLow. This provides the widest mode selection of any filter node, including a dedicated resonant lowpass mode separate from the standard Butterworth lowpass.

The biquad uses a standard Direct Form II topology. It is well suited for static EQ and slowly changing parameters but can produce clicks or instability under rapid modulation. For filter sweeps driven by envelopes or LFOs, prefer [filters.svf]($SN.filters.svf$) or [filters.svf_eq]($SN.filters.svf_eq$).

## Notes

Changing the Mode parameter at runtime resets the filter state, which can produce a click. Avoid switching modes during audio playback.

The LowPass mode (mode 0) provides a clean Butterworth response with no resonance control. If you need a resonant lowpass, use ResoLow (mode 5) instead, which responds to the Q parameter.
