  filters.svf_eq

  SVF-based parametric EQ with five modes: LowPass, HighPass, LowShelf, HighShelf, and Peak. Uses double-precision processing with built-in per-sample coefficient smoothing for zipper-free parameter changes.

  Signal flow:
    audio in -> SVF EQ (mixing-matrix output selection) -> audio out

  CPU: low, polyphonic

  Parameters:
    Frequency: 20 - 20000 Hz (default 1000). Cutoff or centre frequency.
    Q: 0.3 - 9.9 (default 1.0). Bandwidth or resonance.
    Gain: -18 - 18 dB (default 0). Boost/cut for LowShelf, HighShelf, Peak. Ignored by LowPass, HighPass.
    Smoothing: 0 - 1 s (default 0.01). Parameter interpolation time.
    Mode: LowPass, HighPass, LowShelf, HighShelf, Peak (default LowPass).
    Enabled: Off / On (default On). Hard bypass.

  When to use:
    Parametric EQ in scriptnode. Preferred over filters.biquad for modulated EQ due to SVF stability. Use filters.svf instead when gain control is not needed.

  Common mistakes:
    Gain is ignored in LowPass/HighPass modes - use LowShelf/HighShelf/Peak for boost/cut.

An SVF-based parametric EQ with five modes: LowPass, HighPass, LowShelf, HighShelf, and Peak. Unlike [filters.svf]($SN.filters.svf$), this node responds to the Gain parameter in its shelving and peak modes, making it the primary choice for EQ bands in scriptnode.

The filter uses double-precision arithmetic and includes built-in per-sample coefficient smoothing on top of the standard Smoothing parameter, providing particularly clean parameter transitions. This is the most-used filter node in practice.

## Notes

The double-precision processing provides slightly better numerical accuracy than [filters.svf]($SN.filters.svf$), which can matter when cascading multiple EQ bands.

For simple lowpass/highpass filtering without gain control, [filters.svf]($SN.filters.svf$) is sufficient and offers additional modes (BP, Notch, Allpass) that this node does not provide.

**See also:** $SN.filters.svf$ -- SVF without gain modes (LP/HP/BP/Notch/Allpass), $SN.filters.biquad$ -- biquad with similar EQ modes but different topology
