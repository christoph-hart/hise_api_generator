  routing.event_data_reader

  Reads per-event data from one of 16 storage slots and outputs it as a polyphonic modulation signal. Two modes: Static (read once at note-on) and dynamic (read continuously).

  Signal flow:
    Control node -- no audio processing
    note-on event -> capture event ID -> read storage[eventId][SlotIndex] -> modulation output

  CPU: negligible, polyphonic

  Parameters:
    SlotIndex: 0 - 16, step 1 (default 0). Which data slot to read.
    Static: Off / On (default Off). Off = read continuously; On = read once at note-on.

  When to use:
    Per-voice parameter variation based on data written by event_data_writer or the scripting API. Static mode replicates the EventData Voice Start Modulator; dynamic mode replicates the EventData Envelope. Specialised feature -- not commonly used in surveyed projects.

  Common mistakes:
    Requires MIDI processing context. Static mode reads once at note-on only.

---

Reads per-event data from one of 16 storage slots and outputs it as a polyphonic modulation signal. Each voice reads the value associated with its own note-on event ID, enabling per-voice parameter variation. Data is written to these slots by [event_data_writer]($SN.routing.event_data_writer$) nodes or via the scripting API.

The node operates in two modes controlled by the Static parameter. When Static is off, the node continuously reads from storage on each audio callback and sends a modulation signal whenever the value changes. When Static is on, the value is captured once at note-on and cached -- subsequent changes to the storage are ignored for that voice. Static mode replicates the behaviour of the EventData Voice Start Modulator, while dynamic mode replicates the EventData Envelope.

## Notes

This node must be placed in a MIDI processing context, and the global routing manager must be initialised externally. Without a MIDI context, no event IDs are captured and no values are read.

This node can be compiled within a DLL network as it does not depend on dynamic connections.
