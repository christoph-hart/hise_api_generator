  routing.local_cable_unscaled

  Routes an unnormalised control value between nodes sharing the same LocalId within a single DspNetwork. Identical to local_cable but values bypass range conversion on both input and output.

  Signal flow:
    Control node -- no audio processing
    Value param (raw) -> broadcast to peers with same LocalId -> modulation output (raw, unnormalised)

  CPU: negligible, monophonic

  Parameters:
    Value: arbitrary range (nominal 0.0 - 1.0, default 0.0). Raw value routed without range conversion.

  When to use:
    Replacing visual cable connections for unscaled parameter contexts. The IDE automatically selects this variant when replacing an unscaled connection with a local cable.

---

A variant of [local_cable]($SN.routing.local_cable$) that passes values through without range conversion. Both the input and the modulation output bypass normalisation, so the raw value from the source arrives unchanged at the target. Use this when connecting parameters or modulation sources that operate in their native value ranges rather than the normalised 0..1 range.

All other behaviour is identical to local_cable -- bidirectional routing within a single network, recursion guard, and the same LocalId-based peer system.

## Notes

When using the connection editor to replace a cable with a local cable, the IDE automatically detects whether the connection is scaled or unscaled and creates the appropriate variant.
