  routing.global_cable

  Routes a normalised 0..1 control value across all DspNetworks via a named cable connection. Bidirectional -- any global_cable node on the same Connection ID can send or receive. A recursion guard prevents feedback loops.

  Signal flow:
    Control node -- no audio processing
    Value param -> broadcast to all peers on same Connection -> modulation output on receivers

  CPU: negligible, monophonic

  Parameters:
    Value: 0.0 - 1.0 (default 1.0). Control value sent/received through the cable.

  When to use:
    Cross-network control value routing. 13 instances across surveyed projects (rank 30). Use for linking parameters between different DspNetworks or for OSC integration (IDs starting with /). Prefer routing.local_cable when connections stay within a single network.

  Common mistakes:
    Values are always clamped to 0..1 -- use range converters for wider ranges.

---

Routes a normalised control value between any number of nodes across all DspNetworks via a shared named connection. Each global_cable node acts as both sender and receiver -- setting the Value parameter broadcasts it to every other global_cable sharing the same Connection ID, and incoming values from peers appear on the modulation output. A built-in recursion guard prevents feedback loops.

Cable IDs starting with `/` integrate with OSC. When an OSC receiver is active, incoming OSC messages are normalised to 0..1 using the configured input range. When an OSC sender is active, outgoing values are denormalised using the configured output range.

## Notes

Global cables can be compiled to C++ for use in exported plugins. The compiled node uses hash-based addressing to connect to the cable system at runtime.

For C++ integration, external nodes can send values back to HISE through the cable system -- useful for displaying internal state such as gain reduction or level metering on the UI.
