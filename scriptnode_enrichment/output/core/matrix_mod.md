commonMistakes:

    wrong: "Adding the node and expecting modulation output with default settings"
    right: "Set Intensity to a non-zero value. The default of 0.0 means no modulation effect."
    explanation: "The Intensity parameter defaults to 0.0, which means the modulation output has no effect regardless of the source signal. Increase Intensity to hear the modulation."
  - title: "Expecting output clamped to 0-1"
    wrong: "Assuming downstream parameters receive values in the 0-1 range"
    right: "Unlike core.global_mod, this node does not clamp output. Downstream nodes must handle values outside 0-1."
    explanation: "The mode formulas in matrix_mod do not clamp the result to 0-1 as global_mod does. In Unipolar and Bipolar modes especially, the output may exceed this range."

  core.matrix_mod

  A dual-source modulation node that reads two modulators from the GlobalModulatorContainer. The source provides the main signal; the aux modulator dynamically scales the modulation intensity. Combines them using Scale, Unipolar, or Bipolar mode with inversion and zero-position options. Output is NOT clamped to 0-1.

  Signal flow:
    source modulator + aux modulator -> mode formula (Scale/Unipolar/Bipolar) -> audio ch0 + modulation output

  CPU: low, polyphonic

  Parameters:
    SourceIndex (-1 - 64, default -1): Primary source (-1 = disconnected).
    Intensity (-1.0 - 1.0, default 0.0): Overall modulation depth (base value for aux).
    Mode (Scale / Unipolar / Bipolar, default Scale): Combination formula.
    Inverted (Normal / Inverted, default Normal): Flips source signal.
    AuxIndex (-1 - 64, default -1): Auxiliary source (-1 = disconnected).
    AuxIntensity (0.0 - 1.0, default 0.0): How much aux signal affects intensity.
    ZeroPosition (Left / Center, default Left): Modulation centre for Scale mode.

  When to use:
    - Modulation depth that varies dynamically (e.g. velocity controlling vibrato depth)
    - Complex modulation routing with source inversion and centre offset
    - When global_mod's single-source approach is insufficient

  Common mistakes:
    - Default Intensity is 0.0 -- must increase for modulation to take effect
    - Output is not clamped to 0-1

The matrix mod node extends [core.global_mod]($SN.core.global_mod$) with dual-source modulation from the [GlobalModulatorContainer]($MODULES.GlobalModulatorContainer$). It reads two modulators: a primary source and an auxiliary source. The aux signal dynamically modulates the intensity of the source signal, enabling scenarios such as velocity-controlled vibrato depth or expression-dependent modulation amount.

The node offers three combination modes (Scale, Unipolar, Bipolar) along with source inversion and a zero-position offset for Scale mode. Unlike global_mod, the output is not clamped to 0-1, so downstream nodes should account for values outside that range. Both sources start disconnected (index -1) and the Intensity defaults to 0.0, so the node must be explicitly configured before it produces any modulation effect.

## Notes

The three modes work differently from [core.global_mod]($SN.core.global_mod$):

- **Scale:** The aux-modulated intensity scales the source signal multiplicatively, with an optional centre offset from ZeroPosition. When ZeroPosition is Center, modulation is centred around 0.5.
- **Unipolar:** The source signal is multiplied by the aux-modulated intensity and added to the input.
- **Bipolar:** The source is converted to a bipolar range (-1 to +1), scaled by the aux-modulated intensity, and added to the input.

The node can track envelope voice lifecycle -- when the source is an envelope modulator, the node reports whether the voice is still active, which integrates with voice management.
