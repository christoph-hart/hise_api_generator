  core.phasor_fm

  A ramp generator identical to core.phasor but reads the input signal on channel 0 as frequency modulation before overwriting it with the ramp output. The input scales the phase increment per sample.

  Signal flow:
    read channel 0 as FM -> generate ramp -> overwrite channel 0

  CPU: negligible, polyphonic

  Parameters:
    Gate (Off/On, default On): Enables output; rising edge resets phase
    Frequency (20-20000 Hz, default 220): Base ramp frequency, overridden by MIDI note-on
    Freq Ratio (1-16, default 1): Integer pitch multiplier
    Phase (0-100%, default 0%): Phase offset

  When to use:
    - Building FM synthesis patches where you need a ramp (not sine) as the carrier
    - Custom waveshaping with frequency modulation
    - Use core.fm instead when you want a sine carrier with FM

  Common mistakes:
    - FM source must be placed before phasor_fm in the chain

The phasor_fm node works like [core.phasor]($SN.core.phasor$) but reads the existing signal on channel 0 as a frequency modulator before replacing it with the ramp output. The input value scales the phase increment per sample: a value of 1.0 means normal speed, 2.0 doubles the rate, and 0.0 freezes the phase. Negative values reverse the ramp direction.

This node is the building block for FM synthesis patches where you need a ramp carrier rather than a sine. Feed the ramp output into a waveshaper or table lookup to create the final carrier waveform.

## Notes

The FM modulation source must appear before this node in the signal chain, since channel 0 is read as the modulator and then overwritten with the ramp output. With extreme modulation values the phase can advance multiple cycles per sample, producing erratic jumps in the output even though all values remain in the 0-1 range.
