commonMistakes:
  - title: "RecordingLength must be set before recording"
    wrong: "Leaving RecordingLength at 0 and toggling State to On"

    explanation: "A RecordingLength of 0 allocates no buffer, so no samples are captured. Always set a positive value first."

  core.recorder

  Records the input audio into an internal buffer and writes it to an audio file slot when recording completes. Audio passes through unmodified during recording.

  Signal flow:
    audio in -> record to buffer (when State=On) -> flush to AudioFile slot
    audio in -> audio out (passthrough)

  CPU: negligible (idle), low (recording)

  Parameters:
    State (Off / On, default Off): starts or stops recording
    RecordingLength (0 - 2000 ms, default 0): recording duration in milliseconds

  When to use:
    Rarely used (rank 108, 1 instance). Use to capture audio snippets for playback via core.file_player, for live sampling, or for UI display via the DisplayBufferSource API.

  Common mistakes:
    RecordingLength must be set before recording -- a value of 0 captures nothing.

![Node screenshot](/images/custom/scriptnode/recorder.png)

This node records the input audio signal into an internal buffer and writes it to an audio file slot when recording completes. The audio signal passes through completely unmodified during recording. When the buffer is full, the recorded audio is automatically flushed to the audio file slot, where it can be picked up by other nodes (such as [core.file_player]($SN.core.file_player$)) or displayed on the UI using the [DisplayBufferSource]($API.DisplayBufferSource$) scripting API.

Recording starts when State is set to On and stops automatically when the buffer reaches the configured RecordingLength. Setting State to On again resets the recording position and starts a new capture.

## Notes

The recorder supports mono and stereo input, matching the channel count of its container.

The audio file slot is written asynchronously when the buffer is full. The recorded data is then available to any node referencing the same audio file slot.
