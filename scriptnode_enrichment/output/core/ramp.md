  - title: "Ramp adds to the audio signal"
    wrong: "Expecting the ramp to only output via modulation and leave the audio untouched"
    right: "The ramp value is added to the audio signal on all channels. If you only need modulation output, place the ramp outside the main signal path or use math.clear after it."
    explanation: "The node serves as both a modulation source and an audio generator. The ramp value is always added to the audio buffer, which can introduce a DC offset or unwanted signal if not accounted for."

  core.ramp

  Free-running ramp generator that cycles from 0 to 1 at a configurable period. Outputs both a normalised modulation signal and an additive contribution to the audio buffer.

  Signal flow:
    ramp(PeriodTime) -> audio += ramp value, modulation output = ramp value

  CPU: negligible, polyphonic

  Parameters:
    PeriodTime (0.1-1000 ms, default 100): Duration of one ramp cycle
    LoopStart (0-100%, default 0%): Phase position the ramp wraps back to after reaching 1.0
    Gate (Off/On, default On): Enables the ramp; rising edge resets phase

  When to use:
    - Free-running LFO-style modulation at a fixed rate
    - Driving waveshapers or table lookups with a periodic ramp
    - Use core.clock_ramp instead when the ramp must lock to DAW tempo

  Common mistakes:
    - Ramp adds to the audio signal on all channels, not just modulation

The ramp node generates a linear 0-1 sawtooth signal at a configurable period and outputs it in two ways: as a normalised modulation signal (via the modulation output) and as an additive contribution to the audio buffer on all channels. This dual output makes it suitable both as a modulation source for parameter control and as a signal generator for waveshaping pipelines.

When the ramp reaches 1.0 it wraps back to the LoopStart position and continues cycling. Setting LoopStart above zero shortens the effective ramp range, cycling between LoopStart and 1.0.

## Notes

The ramp adds its value to the audio signal on all channels. If you only need the modulation output, either place the node in a dedicated modulation chain or follow it with a [math.clear]($SN.math.clear$) node to remove the audio contribution.

When Gate is off, no processing occurs: the audio passes through unmodified and no modulation signal is sent.
