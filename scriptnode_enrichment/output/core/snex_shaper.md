  core.snex_shaper

  A waveshaper node where the transfer function is defined by user-written SNEX code. The node displays the shaping curve by passing test samples through the user code.

  Signal flow:
    audio in -> SNEX shaper code -> audio out

  CPU: variable (depends on user SNEX code), monophonic

  Parameters:
    All parameters are user-defined in the SNEX code.

  When to use:
    - Custom waveshaping or saturation curves
    - Transfer functions not available from built-in math nodes
    - Visualising the shaping curve in the node display

The SNEX shaper wraps a user-written [SNEX]($LANG.snex$) waveshaping function and applies it to the incoming audio signal. The node displays a visual representation of the transfer curve by passing test values through the shaper code, making it straightforward to verify the shape.

The SNEX code can implement either a simple `getSample` function that processes one sample at a time, or provide full `process` and `processFrame` callbacks for more complex shaping that requires state. Parameters defined in the SNEX code are automatically exposed on the node. Unlike [core.snex_node]($SN.core.snex_node$), this node does not receive MIDI events.

## Parameters

All parameters are defined dynamically by the user's SNEX code. The node itself has no built-in parameters.

## Notes

The `ClassId` property selects which SNEX shaper class to compile. The SNEX code can optionally implement `setExternalData` to access tables or audio files for lookup-based shaping.

When compiled to C++, the shaper class receives the voice count as a template argument, allowing per-voice state if needed in a polyphonic context. However, within the scriptnode interpreter the node itself operates monophonically.
