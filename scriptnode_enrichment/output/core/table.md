    wrong: "Expecting core.table to act as a waveshaper that modifies the audio signal"
    right: "The audio passes through unmodified. The table lookup result is used for display only."
    explanation: "Despite the description mentioning waveshaping, this node reads the input magnitude for visualisation but does not alter the audio. Use a custom SNEX node or math.tanh for actual waveshaping."

  core.table

  A symmetrical lookup table node. Reads the absolute input magnitude, maps it through a user-editable table, and displays the result. The audio signal passes through unmodified.

  Signal flow:
    audio in -> abs(sample) -> table lookup -> display
    audio in -> audio out (passthrough)

  CPU: negligible, monophonic

  Parameters:
    None

  When to use:
    Unused in surveyed networks. Use when you need to visualise a table-mapped version of the input signal magnitude. Not suitable for audio waveshaping.

This node reads the absolute value of the input audio signal, maps it through a user-editable 512-point lookup table, and displays the result. The audio signal itself passes through completely unmodified. The table lookup is symmetrical: positive and negative input values of the same magnitude map to the same table position.

The lookup table is editable through the node's UI. The input range of 0 to 1 (after taking the absolute value) maps across the full table.

## Notes

This node has no parameters. The table curve is edited directly through the node's graphical interface.

The table uses linear interpolation between its 512 entries for smooth lookup results.
