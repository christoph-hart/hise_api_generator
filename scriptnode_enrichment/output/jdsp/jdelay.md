  jdsp.jdelay

  A delay line using linear interpolation between samples. Lowest CPU cost of the three jdelay variants, but non-integer delay times cause mild high-frequency roll-off (inherent to linear interpolation). Polyphonic -- each voice has an independent delay buffer.

  Signal flow:
    audio in -> per-channel delay with linear interpolation -> audio out

  CPU: low, polyphonic

  Parameters:
    Limit (0 - 1000 ms mono / 0 - 30 ms poly, default max) - maximum delay buffer size; affects memory, not CPU
    DelayTime (0 - 1000 ms mono / 0 - 30 ms poly, default 0) - actual delay time; no smoothing applied

  Polyphonic range:
    When used polyphonically, the parameter range is reduced from 0-1000 ms to 0-30 ms to limit per-voice memory usage.

  When to use:
    General-purpose delay where mild high-frequency colouring is acceptable. For modulated delays (chorus/flanger) where flat response matters, use jdelay_cubic. For fixed delays where modulation stability is not needed, jdelay_thiran offers flat response at lower CPU cost.

  Common mistakes:
    No smoothing on DelayTime -- use smoothed_parameter or core.fix_delay.
    Audio-rate modulation needs frame2_block container.

  See also:
    alternative jdsp.jdelay_cubic -- flat response, higher CPU
    alternative jdsp.jdelay_thiran -- flat response, not for fast modulation
    alternative core.fix_delay -- delay with built-in smoothing
---

A delay line that uses linear interpolation to calculate values between samples. This is the cheapest of the three delay line variants, but non-integer delay times cause a mild high-frequency roll-off because linear interpolation acts as a low-pass filter. The effect is more noticeable at lower sample rates and with rapidly modulated delay times.

Each voice maintains its own delay buffer, so the node can be used in polyphonic contexts where each voice needs an independent delay. When used polyphonically, the maximum delay time is reduced from 1000 ms to 30 ms to keep per-voice memory usage reasonable.

> [!Warning:No delay time smoothing] The delay time is applied immediately without any ramping. Connect a [smoothed_parameter]($SN.control.smoothed_parameter$) node before the DelayTime input to prevent clicks, or use [core.fix_delay]($SN.core.fix_delay$) which includes built-in smoothing.

> [!Tip:Use frame processing for modulation effects] For chorus or flanger effects, place the delay node and its modulation source inside a [frame2_block]($SN.container.frame2_block$) container. This ensures delay time updates happen every sample rather than once per block.

### Interpolation Comparison

The three jdelay variants share identical parameters and differ only in how they calculate values between samples:

| Variant | Interpolation | Frequency Response | Modulation | CPU |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|------------|-----|
| **jdelay** | Linear | High-frequency roll-off | Acceptable | Low |
| [jdelay_cubic]($SN.jdsp.jdelay_cubic$) | Lagrange 3rd-order | Flat | Best | Medium |
| [jdelay_thiran]($SN.jdsp.jdelay_thiran$) | Thiran allpass | Flat | Not suitable | Low |

**See also:** [$SN.jdsp.jdelay_cubic$]($SN.jdsp.jdelay_cubic$) -- flat frequency response, highest CPU, [$SN.jdsp.jdelay_thiran$]($SN.jdsp.jdelay_thiran$) -- flat response, not for fast modulation, [$SN.core.fix_delay$]($SN.core.fix_delay$) -- delay with built-in parameter smoothing
