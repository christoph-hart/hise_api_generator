  template.bipolar_mod

  A composite template that provides a bipolar modulation source. Converts a user-supplied signal into a bipolar offset around a base value, with adjustable intensity.

  Signal flow:
    mod_signal (user source) -> sig2mod (scale to 0..1) -> peak (capture value) -> bipolar (scale to -Intensity..+Intensity) -> pma (Value + offset) -> modulation output

  CPU: negligible, monophonic
    Runs entirely at control rate. All internal nodes are lightweight control/math operations.

  Parameters:
    Value (0.0 - 1.0, default 0.0): Base/centre value for the modulation output. When Intensity is 0, the output equals this value.
    Intensity (0.0 - 1.0, default 0.0): Modulation depth. At 0, no bipolar offset is applied. At 1, the full range is added.

  When to use:
    Use when you need a modulation source with a tuneable centre point and adjustable depth. Typical applications include vibrato, tremolo, or any parameter modulation that should oscillate around a user-defined base value.

  Common mistakes:
    The pma output must be manually connected to a target parameter. The dummy ramp must be replaced with an actual modulation source.

This template provides a ready-made bipolar modulation source. It takes a signal from a user-supplied source, converts it to a 0..1 range, then applies a bipolar scaling around a base value. The result is a modulation output that oscillates between `Value - Intensity` and `Value + Intensity`, suitable for driving any target parameter.

The template runs entirely at control rate and contains a placeholder [ramp]($SN.core.ramp$) inside the `mod_signal` chain. Replace this dummy source with your actual modulation signal (LFO, envelope follower, expression input, etc.), then connect the [pma]($SN.control.pma$) node's modulation output to the parameter you want to modulate.

## Notes

- The `mod_signal` chain expects a source that produces a signal in the -1..1 audio range. The internal sig2mod stage converts this to 0..1 before bipolar scaling.
- The entire template runs at control rate (decimated sample rate), so it is not suitable for audio-rate modulation that requires sample-accurate timing.
- The internal pma node's Multiply parameter is fixed at 1.0 and not exposed, simplifying the formula to `output = Value + offset`.
