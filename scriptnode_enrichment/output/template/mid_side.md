  template.mid_side

  A composite template that provides a mid/side processing framework. Decodes stereo L/R to M/S, routes mid and side to independent mono processing chains, then re-encodes to stereo L/R.

  Signal flow:
    stereo L/R -> ms_decode -> container.multi -> mid_chain (ch0) + side_chain (ch1) -> ms_encode -> stereo L/R

  CPU: negligible, monophonic
    Adds only matrix encode/decode (2 additions per sample) and two gain multiplies. Actual cost depends on user processing.

  Parameters:
    No exposed top-level parameters.
    Internal: mid_gain (0.0 - 1.0, default 1.0), side_gain (0.0 - 1.0, default 1.0).

  When to use:
    Use for any effect that needs separate control over centre (mid) and stereo width (side) content. Common applications include stereo width control, mid/side EQ, and mid/side compression for mastering.

  Common mistakes:
    Requires stereo input. Each processing chain is mono.

![Mid/side template](/images/custom/scriptnode/ms_after.png)

This template provides a ready-made mid/side processing framework. It decodes a stereo input into mid (centre) and side (stereo width) components using [ms_decode]($SN.routing.ms_decode$), routes each to an independent mono processing chain via a [multi container]($SN.container.multi$), then re-encodes the result to stereo with [ms_encode]($SN.routing.ms_encode$). The round-trip is unity gain when no processing is applied.

Both the mid_chain and side_chain contain placeholder gain nodes at unity (passthrough). Add your processing nodes inside these chains - for example, EQ, compression, or saturation applied independently to mid and side content. Adjust the internal `mid_gain` and `side_gain` values to control the balance between centre and stereo width, or expose them as macro parameters for top-level control.

## Notes

- This template requires a stereo (2-channel) input signal. With mono input the side channel is always zero, rendering the side chain ineffective.
- Setting `side_gain` to 0 collapses the output to mono. Reducing it narrows the stereo image; increasing `mid_gain` relative to `side_gain` emphasises the centre content.
- Each processing chain is mono. Use mono-compatible nodes inside mid_chain and side_chain.
- Common applications include mid/side EQ for mastering, independent compression on centre and width content, and stereo width adjustment via gain balance.
