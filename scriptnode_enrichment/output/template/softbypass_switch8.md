    wrong: "Expecting hard switching with an immediate transition"
    right: "The switch uses soft bypass crossfading -- there is a brief overlap during transitions."

  template.softbypass_switch8

  A pre-built 8-way signal path switch with click-free crossfading. Uses an xfader in Switch mode to activate one of eight soft_bypass containers at a time. This is the largest pre-built variant.

  Signal flow:
    Switch param -> xfader -> bypass state for sb1..sb8
    audio in -> sb1 -> sb2 -> ... -> sb8 -> audio out
    Only one path is active; the others pass audio through unmodified.

  CPU: low, monophonic
    Baseline overhead is minimal. Actual cost depends on the processing inside the active path. During transitions, two paths process briefly. The overhead of seven inactive soft_bypass pass-throughs is negligible.

  Parameters:
    Switch: 0 - 7 (step 1, default 0.0) -- selects the active signal path

  When to use:
    Use when you need to switch between up to eight different processing chains without audible clicks. This is the largest pre-built variant. Replace the dummy nodes inside each soft_bypass container with your processing. For hard switching without crossfade, use container.branch instead.

  Common mistakes:
    Expecting an instant transition -- the switch crossfades over 20ms by default.

This template provides a click-free 8-way signal path switch, the largest pre-built variant in the softbypass_switch family. It contains eight [soft_bypass]($SN.container.soft_bypass$) containers controlled by an [xfader]($SN.control.xfader$) in Switch mode. Setting the Switch parameter activates one container and bypasses the others, with a smooth crossfade during the transition to prevent clicks.

Each container holds a placeholder dummy node. Replace these with your actual processing chains to create eight switchable signal paths. Only the active path applies its processing; the bypassed paths pass audio through unmodified. During a switch transition, both the outgoing and incoming paths process simultaneously for a brief crossfade period (20ms by default). The overhead of seven inactive soft_bypass containers passing audio through is negligible.

## Notes

- During a switch transition, both the outgoing and incoming paths process simultaneously for the crossfade duration. This briefly doubles the processing load.
- The default crossfade time is 20ms per container. You can adjust the SmoothingTime property on each [soft_bypass]($SN.container.soft_bypass$) container individually.
- Setting SmoothingTime to 0 makes the switch behave as a hard bypass (immediate, may click).
- This is the largest pre-built variant. If you need more than 8 switch paths, you can build the structure manually using [container.soft_bypass]($SN.container.soft_bypass$) and [control.xfader]($SN.control.xfader$).
