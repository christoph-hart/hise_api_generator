  math.fmod

  Computes the floating-point remainder (modulo) of each sample divided by the Value parameter. Wraps the signal into a repeating range.

  Signal flow:
    audio in -> fmod(sample, Value) -> audio out

  CPU: medium, polyphonic

  Parameters:
    Value (0.0 - 1.0, default 1.0): Modulo divisor. At 0.0 the signal passes through unchanged (zero guard).

  When to use:
    Use for waveshaping effects that wrap a signal into a bounded range, producing sharp harmonics. Higher CPU cost than simple arithmetic nodes due to the per-sample modulo calculation.

Computes the floating-point remainder of each sample divided by the Value parameter. This wraps the signal into a repeating range, which can be used for waveshaping effects that produce sharp harmonic content.

At a Value of 0.0 the signal passes through unchanged as a safety guard against division by zero.

## Notes

This node has a higher CPU cost than simple arithmetic math nodes because the modulo operation is computed per sample without hardware acceleration.
