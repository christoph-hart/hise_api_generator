  container.split

  A parallel container that copies the input signal to each child node and sums their outputs. Each child processes independently - they do not see each other's modifications.

  Signal flow:
    input --copy--> child[0] --\
    input --copy--> child[1] ---+--> sum --> output
    input --copy--> child[N] --/

  CPU: low, monophonic
    Buffer copy on entry; one copy + add per child beyond the first.

  Parameters:
    None

  When to use:
    Parallel effect chains, dry/wet mixing, multiband processing, any topology where the same input feeds multiple independent processing paths whose results are combined.

  Common mistakes:
    Summing multiple children at unity gain increases the output level. Compensate with gain staging.

The split container creates parallel signal paths. Each child receives a copy of the original input, processes it independently, and all outputs are summed together. This is the standard way to build dry/wet mixers, parallel effect chains, and multiband processors.

Bypassed children are skipped - they contribute nothing to the output sum. When the entire split is bypassed, audio passes through unmodified. With only a single child, no buffer copies are made and the container behaves identically to a chain.

glossary:
  functions:
    copy input:
      desc: "Saves a copy of the original input before child processing"
    sum outputs:
      desc: "Adds each child's output to the combined result"

```
// container.split - parallel processing with output summing
// audio in -> audio out

dispatch(input) {
    original = copy input
    child[0].process(input)             // first child: in-place
    for each remaining child:
        work = copy original
        child[i].process(work)
        sum outputs(input, work)        // add to result
}
```

## Notes

- Each child receives an independent copy of the original input. Changes made by one child do not affect other children.
- Memory cost is constant regardless of child count - a single work buffer is reused for each additional child.
