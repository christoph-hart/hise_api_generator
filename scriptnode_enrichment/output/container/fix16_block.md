  container.fix16_block

  Serial container that splits the incoming audio buffer into chunks of at most 16 samples. Children process each chunk sequentially. Increases modulation update rate to roughly 2.8 kHz at 44.1 kHz sample rate.

  Signal flow:
    audio in -> split into 16-sample chunks -> children process each chunk serially -> audio out

  CPU: negligible, monophonic

  Parameters: none

  When to use:
    When modulation needs a faster update rate than the host buffer but fix8_block is too expensive. Good compromise for audio-rate modulation that tolerates slight stepping.

The `fix16_block` container splits the incoming audio buffer into chunks of at most 16 samples and processes its children serially on each chunk. This provides a modulation update rate of roughly 2.8 kHz at 44.1 kHz sample rate - half the precision of [fix8_block]($SN.container.fix8_block$) but with half the chunk iteration overhead (32 iterations for a 512-sample buffer).

This variant sits between [fix8_block]($SN.container.fix8_block$) and [fix32_block]($SN.container.fix32_block$) on the precision/CPU tradeoff spectrum. It is a reasonable choice when filter cutoff or oscillator pitch modulation needs sub-millisecond accuracy but fix8_block's overhead is too high for the context.

process(input) {
    for each chunk of 16 samples in input:
        children.process(chunk)

## Notes

The block size of 16 is a maximum. The last chunk may be smaller if the host buffer size is not a multiple of 16. MIDI events are distributed across chunks by timestamp for sub-block timing accuracy.

When bypassed, children process the full host buffer without chunking, equivalent to a [container.chain]($SN.container.chain$). Toggling bypass triggers a full re-preparation of all children. If the network is already in frame mode, this container becomes a no-op.
