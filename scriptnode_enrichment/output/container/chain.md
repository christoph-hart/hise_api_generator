  container.chain

  A serial container that processes child nodes in sequence. Each child modifies the audio buffer in place and passes it to the next.

  Signal flow:
    input -> child[0] -> child[1] -> ... -> child[N] -> output

  CPU: negligible (pure dispatch), monophonic

  Parameters:
    None

  When to use:
    The default container for any serial signal path. Use for effect chains, processing pipelines, or any sequence of operations where each step feeds the next.

  Common mistakes:
    Chain uses hard bypass with no crossfade. Use container.soft_bypass for click-free transitions.

The chain is the fundamental building block of every scriptnode network. It processes child nodes one after another in list order - each child receives the output of the previous child and modifies the audio buffer in place.

When bypassed, no children are processed and audio passes through unmodified. This is a hard bypass with no crossfade, which may cause clicks with stateful effects such as filters or delays. For click-free bypass transitions, use [container.soft_bypass]($SN.container.soft_bypass$) instead.

```
// container.chain - serial processing
// audio in -> audio out

dispatch(input) {
    for each child in list order:
        child.process(input)    // in-place
}
```

## Notes

- The `IsVertical` property controls UI layout direction (vertical or horizontal) without affecting processing.
- MIDI events are forwarded to all children in list order. If a child modifies an event, subsequent children see the modified version.
