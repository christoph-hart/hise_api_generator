  container.dynamic_blocksize

  Serial container whose block size is controlled by a modulatable parameter. Splits audio into chunks of the selected size. When set to index 0 (block size 1), switches to per-sample frame processing.

  Signal flow:
    audio in -> BlockSize parameter selects chunk size -> children process each chunk/frame serially -> audio out

  CPU: negligible, monophonic. Smaller block sizes increase iteration count linearly.

  Parameters:
    BlockSize: 0 - 7, step 1 (default 4 = 64 samples). Index into [1, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512].

  When to use:
    When the end user should be able to choose a quality/CPU tradeoff at runtime, such as a "quality" knob in a synthesiser. Connect the parameter to a network parameter or control cable for automation.

  Common mistakes:
    Parameter is an index (0-7), not the block size itself. Index 4 = 64 samples.

The `dynamic_blocksize` container processes its children with a block size controlled by a modulatable parameter. Unlike [fix_blockx]($SN.container.fix_blockx$) where the block size is a design-time property, this node exposes it as a parameter that can be connected to network parameters or control cables. This makes it suitable for end-user "quality" settings that trade CPU cost for modulation precision at runtime.

When the BlockSize parameter is set to index 0 (block size 1), the container switches to per-sample frame processing, functionally equivalent to [framex_block]($SN.container.framex_block$). This means a single parameter can sweep the full range from frame-accurate processing down to coarse 512-sample chunks.

## Notes

Block sizes 2 and 4 are deliberately excluded from the table. These values would conflict with the internal event raster (default 8 samples), which could cause control-rate processing issues.

When the block size changes at runtime, a brief silence (one buffer) may occur while children are re-prepared with the new block size. The audio thread is never blocked - if re-preparation is in progress, the current buffer outputs silence instead.

The compiled output retains the full block size dispatch, unlike [fix_blockx]($SN.container.fix_blockx$) which bakes a single static size. This adds one branch per buffer but preserves runtime flexibility.

When bypassed, children process the full host buffer without chunking. All other behaviours from the `fixN_block` family apply: MIDI events are timestamp-split across chunks, and the block size is a maximum (last chunk may be smaller).
