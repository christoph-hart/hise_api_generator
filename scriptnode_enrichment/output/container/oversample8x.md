  container.oversample8x

  Upsamples the audio signal by a fixed factor of 8, processes child nodes serially at the higher sample rate, then downsamples back with anti-aliasing filtering. Fixed variant of container.oversample - strong aliasing reduction at significant CPU cost.

  Signal flow:
    audio in -> upsample 8x -> child1 -> child2 -> ... -> childN -> downsample 8x -> audio out

  CPU: very_high, monophonic only. Child processing cost is multiplied by 8.

  Parameters:
    FilterType (Polyphase / FIR, default Polyphase) - anti-aliasing filter. Polyphase has lower latency, FIR has steeper rolloff.

  Constraints:
    - Monophonic only (no polyphonic voice context)
    - Block processing only (no frame processing)
    - Cannot be nested inside another oversample container
    - Latency from the anti-aliasing filter is not reported to the host

  When to use:
    Heavy nonlinear processing that generates strong high-order harmonics (aggressive waveshaping, hard clipping, FM synthesis). At 44.1 kHz, children process at 352.8 kHz. Consider whether 4x is sufficient before committing to this CPU cost.

  Common mistakes:
    Cannot nest oversample containers - use a single higher factor instead.
    Cannot be used in polyphonic networks.

    disambiguation container.oversample - dynamic variant with selectable factor
    disambiguation container.oversample4x - fixed 4x variant
    disambiguation container.oversample16x - fixed 16x variant

Upsamples the audio signal by a fixed factor of 8, processes all child nodes serially at the higher sample rate, then downsamples the result back to the original rate with anti-aliasing filtering. At a base sample rate of 44.1 kHz, child nodes process at 352.8 kHz. This provides strong aliasing reduction at significant CPU cost - all child processing is multiplied by 8.

This is a fixed-factor variant of the [oversample]($SN.container.oversample$) container. It does not expose an Oversampling parameter - the factor is always 8x. Both the sample rate and the block size are multiplied by 8 for all child nodes. Use this for heavy nonlinear processing that generates strong high-order harmonics, such as aggressive waveshaping, hard clipping, or FM synthesis. Consider whether [oversample4x]($SN.container.oversample4x$) provides sufficient quality before committing to the higher CPU cost.

## Notes

When bypassed, child nodes revert to the original sample rate and block size. The container re-prepares the entire child chain on bypass state changes.

The anti-aliasing filter introduces a small amount of latency that is not reported to the host or the surrounding network.
