    wrong: "Using oversample16x by default for all nonlinear processing"
    right: "Start with oversample4x and only increase if audible aliasing remains. Reserve 16x for cases with extreme harmonic generation near Nyquist."
    explanation: "16x oversampling multiplies the CPU cost of all child nodes by 16. At 44.1 kHz, children process at 705.6 kHz. In most cases, 4x or 8x oversampling provides sufficient aliasing reduction at a fraction of the cost."

    explanation: "The container checks that the incoming sample rate matches the network's original sample rate. If the signal has already been upsampled, this check fails and the node reports an error."

    wrong: "Placing an oversample16x container inside a polyphonic signal chain"

  container.oversample16x

  Upsamples the audio signal by the maximum fixed factor of 16, processes child nodes serially at the higher sample rate, then downsamples back with anti-aliasing filtering. Fixed variant of container.oversample - maximum aliasing reduction at extreme CPU cost.

  Signal flow:
    audio in -> upsample 16x -> child1 -> child2 -> ... -> childN -> downsample 16x -> audio out

  CPU: very_high, monophonic only. Child processing cost is multiplied by 16.

  Parameters:
    FilterType (Polyphase / FIR, default Polyphase) - anti-aliasing filter. Polyphase has lower latency, FIR has steeper rolloff.

  Constraints:
    - Monophonic only (no polyphonic voice context)
    - Block processing only (no frame processing)
    - Cannot be nested inside another oversample container
    - Latency from the anti-aliasing filter is not reported to the host

  When to use:
    Only when lower factors leave audible aliasing. Typical cases: aggressive waveshaping with harmonics very close to Nyquist, extreme FM synthesis. At 44.1 kHz, children process at 705.6 kHz. Start with 4x and increase only if needed.

  Common mistakes:
    Extreme CPU cost - verify 16x is actually necessary before using.
    Cannot nest oversample containers.
    Cannot be used in polyphonic networks.

---

Upsamples the audio signal by the maximum fixed factor of 16, processes all child nodes serially at the higher sample rate, then downsamples the result back to the original rate with anti-aliasing filtering. At a base sample rate of 44.1 kHz, child nodes process at 705.6 kHz. This is the highest available oversampling factor, providing the strongest aliasing reduction at extreme CPU cost - all child processing is multiplied by 16.

This is a fixed-factor variant of the [oversample]($SN.container.oversample$) container. It does not expose an Oversampling parameter - the factor is always 16x. Both the sample rate and the block size are multiplied by 16 for all child nodes. Reserve this for cases where lower factors leave audible aliasing, such as aggressive waveshaping with harmonics very close to Nyquist or extreme FM synthesis. In most cases, [oversample4x]($SN.container.oversample4x$) or [oversample8x]($SN.container.oversample8x$) provides sufficient quality at a fraction of the CPU cost.

## Notes

When bypassed, child nodes revert to the original sample rate and block size. The container re-prepares the entire child chain on bypass state changes.

The anti-aliasing filter introduces a small amount of latency that is not reported to the host or the surrounding network.
