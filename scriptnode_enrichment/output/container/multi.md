  container.multi

  A parallel container that splits the audio channels among its children. Each child processes a non-overlapping slice of channels. The total channel count equals the sum of all children's channel counts.

  Signal flow:
    input (ch0..chN) -> child[0](ch0..chK) | child[1](chK+1..chM) | ... -> output (ch0..chN)

  CPU: negligible (pointer offset only), monophonic

  Parameters:
    None

  When to use:
    Independent left/right processing, mid/side processing (with routing.ms_encode/ms_decode), or any topology requiring per-channel processing paths.

  Common mistakes:
    Adding more children than available channels raises an error. Ensure channel count >= child count.

The multi container splits the audio channels among its children. In a stereo context with two children, child 0 processes the left channel and child 1 processes the right channel. Each child modifies its channel slice in place with no buffer copying or summing required.

Channels are divided equally during preparation. For mid/side processing, place a [routing.ms_encode]($SN.routing.ms_encode$) node before the multi container and a [routing.ms_decode]($SN.routing.ms_decode$) node after it. Each child then processes the mid or side signal independently.

// audio in (N channels) -> audio out (N channels)

dispatch(input) {
    offset = 0
    for each child:
        channels = child's channel count
        channel split: child.process(input[offset .. offset + channels])
        offset += channels
}
```

## Notes

- Each child receives an independent copy of MIDI events, so one child's event modifications do not affect others.
- The total channel count of the network must be at least equal to the number of children. Excess children beyond the available channels are silently skipped.
