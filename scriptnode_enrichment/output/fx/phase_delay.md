    wrong: "Using fx.phase_delay alone expecting comb filter output"
    right: "Place fx.phase_delay inside a container.split so its output is summed with the dry signal to produce comb filtering."
    explanation: "The node outputs only the phase-shifted signal. Comb filtering requires mixing this with the original signal, which a parallel container provides automatically."

  fx.phase_delay

  First-order allpass filter that shifts the phase of the input signal without changing its amplitude. Designed as the building block for comb filter effects.

  Signal flow:
    audio in -> first-order allpass (phase shift 0 to -180 degrees) -> audio out

  CPU: negligible, polyphonic

  Parameters:
    Frequency (20 - 20000 Hz, skewed, default 400 Hz) - allpass corner frequency where phase shift is -90 degrees. Below this frequency the phase shift approaches 0; above it approaches -180 degrees.

  When to use:
    Building comb filters by placing inside a container.split (so the phase-shifted output sums with the dry signal). Also useful for phaser effects when multiple phase_delay stages are modulated together.

  Common mistakes:
    Does not produce comb filtering on its own - must be summed with the dry signal via a parallel container.

A first-order allpass filter that shifts the phase of the input signal without changing its amplitude. Below the corner frequency the phase shift approaches zero; at the corner frequency it is exactly -90 degrees; above the corner frequency it approaches -180 degrees.

The node is designed as a building block for comb filter effects. On its own it only shifts phase - to produce the characteristic notches and peaks of a comb filter, place it inside a [container.split]($SN.container.split$) so the phase-shifted output is summed with the dry signal. The frequency-dependent phase differences create constructive and destructive interference, producing the comb pattern. Modulating the Frequency parameter sweeps the notch pattern for phaser-style effects.

## Notes

The node processes up to two channels independently, each with its own filter state. Additional channels beyond the first two pass through unmodified.

To build a phaser effect, chain multiple phase_delay nodes in series within a [container.split]($SN.container.split$) and modulate their Frequency parameters together. The number of stages determines the number of notches in the comb pattern.
