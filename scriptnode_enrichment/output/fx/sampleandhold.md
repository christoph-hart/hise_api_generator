  fx.sampleandhold

  Reduces the effective sample rate by holding each captured sample for a set number of periods. Produces the staircase waveform characteristic of low sample rate audio.

  Signal flow:
    audio in -> capture sample every N periods -> hold value for N-1 periods -> audio out

  CPU: negligible, polyphonic

  Parameters:
    Counter (1 - 64, integer, default 1) - number of samples to hold each captured value. 1 = pass-through, 64 = maximum decimation.

  When to use:
    Lo-fi effects, sample rate reduction, retro digital character. Pair with fx.bitcrush for combined bit-depth and sample-rate reduction.

  Common mistakes:
    Counter=1 is pass-through, not an effect.

---

A sample rate reduction effect that captures one input sample and holds its value for a configurable number of periods. The result is a staircase waveform that reduces the effective time resolution of the signal, producing the characteristic lo-fi sound of low sample rate audio.

At Counter=1 the node is a pass-through. As the Counter increases, fewer samples are captured and the decimation becomes more pronounced. At Counter=64 only every 64th sample is captured, reducing the effective sample rate by a factor of 64.

groups:
  - label:
    params:
      - { name: Counter, desc: "Number of samples to hold each captured value. At 1, every sample passes through unchanged. Higher values produce stronger decimation with a more pronounced staircase effect.", range: "1 - 64", default: "1" }

## Notes

Each voice maintains its own counter position and held sample values, so polyphonic use does not share decimation state between voices.

When Counter is large enough that the entire processing block fits within a single hold period, the node uses an optimised block fill rather than per-sample processing.
