  fx.pitch_shift

  Real-time pitch shifting that resamples the input at a different rate and then time-stretches back to the original duration. Supports a range of two octaves down to two octaves up.

  Signal flow:
    audio in -> resample at FreqRatio speed (linear interpolation) -> time stretch back to original duration -> audio out

  CPU: high, polyphonic. Each voice has its own time stretcher instance.

  Parameters:
    FreqRatio (0.25 - 4.0, skewed centre 1.0, default 1.0) - pitch multiplier. 0.5 = one octave down, 1.0 = no shift, 2.0 = one octave up. Continuous (no stepping).

  When to use:
    Real-time pitch shifting of audio signals within scriptnode. For pitch modulation of oscillators, use core.pitch_mod instead. Be aware of CPU cost in polyphonic contexts.

  Common mistakes:
    High CPU per voice - minimise polyphonic voice count.
    Frame processing not supported - use block-based containers only.
    Inherent latency from overlap-add windowing.

---

Real-time pitch shifting that changes the pitch of an audio signal without altering its duration. The node works in two stages: first it resamples the input at a rate determined by FreqRatio, then it applies time stretching to correct the duration back to the original speed. This produces pitch-shifted audio that plays at the original tempo.

The FreqRatio parameter is a multiplicative pitch factor. At 1.0 the signal passes through unchanged. At 2.0 the pitch is shifted one octave up; at 0.5, one octave down. The full range spans two octaves in either direction (0.25 to 4.0). The knob is skewed so that 1.0 (no shift) sits at the centre of the control range.

Quality is generally good for moderate pitch shifts (within roughly one octave). At extreme ratios approaching 0.25 or 4.0, time-stretching artefacts such as phasiness or spectral smearing become more noticeable. The node introduces some processing latency due to the overlap-add windowing used internally.

## Notes

The node has significant CPU cost, especially in polyphonic contexts where each voice maintains its own independent time stretcher instance. Use sparingly with high voice counts, or place it as a monophonic bus effect after voice summing.

Frame-based processing is not supported. The node must be placed in a block-processing context (the default for [container.chain]($SN.container.chain$) and most other containers).

At FreqRatio=1.0 the resampling is 1:1 and the time stretcher receives an equal number of input and output samples, producing an effective pass-through with minimal overhead.
