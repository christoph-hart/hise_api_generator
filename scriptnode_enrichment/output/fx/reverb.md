  fx.reverb

  Freeverb-style algorithmic reverb outputting 100% wet signal. Suitable for adding room ambience and tail to audio signals.

  Signal flow:
    audio in -> 8 parallel comb filters + 4 series allpass filters (100% wet) -> audio out

  CPU: medium, monophonic

  Parameters:
    Damping (0.0 - 1.0, default 0.5) - high-frequency absorption in the reverb tail. Higher values produce a darker, more absorbed sound.
    Width (0.0 - 1.0, default 0.5) - stereo width of the reverb output. Has limited effect on the output.
    Size (0.0 - 1.0, default 0.5) - room size controlling the length of the reverb tail. Higher values produce longer decay.

  When to use:
    Adding algorithmic reverb within a scriptnode network. Place inside a container.split for dry/wet control. For realistic space simulation, consider filters.convolution instead.

  Common mistakes:
    Output is 100% wet - use a parallel container for dry/wet mixing.

---

A Freeverb-style algorithmic reverb that processes the input through parallel comb filters and series allpass filters to produce a diffuse reverb tail. The node outputs a 100% wet signal - to blend with the dry input, place it inside a [container.split]($SN.container.split$) or use a dry/wet template.

The reverb handles both mono and stereo input automatically. With mono input it produces mono output; with stereo input it adds decorrelation between channels for a wider reverb image.

## Notes

The node is monophonic - it processes a single shared reverb rather than duplicating the reverb state per voice. This is the typical usage pattern for reverb, which acts as a shared bus effect.

For dry/wet control, place this node inside a [container.split]($SN.container.split$) alongside the dry signal path. Use a [control.xfader]($SN.control.xfader$) to control the blend.
