    explanation: "At 16 bits there are 65536 quantisation levels, producing noise well below audible threshold. The effect becomes clearly audible below roughly 10-12 bits."

  fx.bitcrush

  Reduces the bit depth of the audio signal by quantising each sample to a stepped curve. Produces the characteristic lo-fi, gritty sound of low bit-depth digital audio. Each voice maintains its own bit depth value; Mode is shared across all voices.

  Signal flow:
    audio in -> quantise to 2^BitDepth levels (rounding depends on Mode) -> audio out

  CPU: low, polyphonic

  Parameters:
    BitDepth (4.0 - 16.0, step 0.1, default 16.0) - number of quantisation bits. Fractional values supported. 16 = transparent, 4 = heavy distortion. Not smoothed - rapid audio-rate modulation can alias; use dynamic_blocksize for frame processing.
    Mode (DC / Bipolar, default DC) - rounding behaviour. DC Offset rounds up (introduces DC bias). Bipolar rounds toward zero (symmetric, no DC bias). Use Bipolar when modulating BitDepth to avoid time-varying DC drift.

  Vintage DAC emulation:
    Wrap with mu-law compression before and expansion after to distribute quantisation logarithmically (more resolution for quiet signals). Models vintage drum machines and 8-bit samplers more accurately than linear bit reduction.

  When to use:
    Lo-fi effects, digital distortion, retro character. Pair with fx.sampleandhold for combined bit-depth and sample-rate reduction.

  Common mistakes:
    DC Offset mode introduces DC bias - use Bipolar for most cases.
    BitDepth 16 is transparent - use lower values for audible effect.

Reduces the bit depth of the audio signal by quantising each sample to a stepped curve. Lower bit depths produce fewer quantisation levels and more pronounced digital distortion, creating the characteristic gritty sound of low bit-depth audio. Fractional bit depth values are supported, allowing smooth modulation of the distortion intensity.

Two modes control how the quantisation rounds values. **DC Offset** mode rounds upward and shifts by half a step, which introduces a small DC bias but produces one extra quantisation step. **Bipolar** mode rounds toward zero for both positive and negative samples, producing symmetric distortion with no DC offset. Bipolar mode is generally preferred unless the DC offset behaviour is specifically desired.

Each voice maintains its own bit depth value, so BitDepth can be modulated independently per voice. The Mode setting is shared across all voices - changing it affects every active voice simultaneously.

### Vintage DAC Emulation

For a more authentic vintage DAC character (drum machines, 8-bit samplers), place a mu-law compression node before fx.bitcrush and a mu-law expansion node after it. This distributes quantisation steps logarithmically - more resolution for quiet signals, less for loud ones - which improves the signal-to-noise ratio at low bit depths compared to linear bit reduction alone.
