Assigns a custom inline function as the control callback for this component, replacing the default `onControl` handler. The function receives two parameters: the component reference and the new value. Pass `false` to revert to the default `onControl` callback. This handles the container's own value changes, not dynamic child values - use `setValueCallback()` for those.

> **Warning:** The function must be declared with `inline function` and must have exactly two parameters. Regular function references are rejected with a script error.
