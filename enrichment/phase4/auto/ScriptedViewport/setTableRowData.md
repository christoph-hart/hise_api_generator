Populates or updates the table with row data. Pass an array of JSON objects whose property keys match the column `ID` values defined in `setTableColumns()`. Unlike the other table setup methods, this can be called at any time to refresh the data -- not just during `onInit`. The data is cloned internally, so changes to your original array after this call are not reflected in the table. [See: Table Mode Setup Sequence](#diagram-table-setup)
