Defines the column structure of the table. Pass an array of column definition objects, each with at least an `"ID"` property that matches the keys in your row data. Use `"Type"` to set the cell type (`"Text"`, `"Button"`, `"Slider"`, `"ComboBox"`, `"Image"`, or `"Hidden"`). Must be called during `onInit` after `setTableMode()`.
