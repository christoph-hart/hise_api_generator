Converts this viewport into a table component. Pass a metadata object to configure table-wide behavior -- key properties include `"RowHeight"`, `"HeaderHeight"`, `"Sortable"`, and `"MultiColumnMode"`. In multi-column mode, the component's value becomes a `[column, row]` array on selection. Must be called during `onInit` as the first step in the table setup sequence. [See: Table Mode Setup Sequence](#diagram-table-setup)
