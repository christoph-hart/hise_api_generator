Restores the UI control values of a script modulator from a base64 string previously obtained from `exportScriptControls`. Only the control values are restored - the script itself is not recompiled.

> **Warning:** Only works on script modulators (Script Voice Start Modulator, Script Time Variant Modulator, Script Envelope Modulator). Calling on a built-in modulator type reports a script error.
