# HISE Scripting API Class Survey

87 scripting API classes analyzed across 6 groups.
Generated from scripting_api.json + C++ source declarations.

## Enrichment Prerequisites

Conceptual dependencies where understanding class A materially
improves the documentation of class B. These are NOT mere factory
relationships (Engine.get*() is not a prerequisite) -- they are cases
where A introduces concepts, conventions, or patterns that B's
documentation needs to reference.

| # | Prerequisite | Before | Rationale |
|---|-------------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | **GlobalRoutingManager** | GlobalCable | OSC address conventions, C++ interop, cable topology |
| 2 | **Content** | All ScriptComponent subclasses | Property system (set/get), component lifecycle, event model |
| 3 | **Synth** | Effect, Modulator, MidiProcessor, ChildSynth, SlotFX, AudioSampleProcessor, TableProcessor, RoutingMatrix | Module tree model, voice system, setAttribute/getAttribute pattern |
| 4 | **Synth** | Builder | Builder constructs what Synth.get*() looks up -- same module tree, different access pattern |
| 5 | **Sampler** | Sample, ComplexGroupManager | Sample map structure, region model, RR groups |
| 6 | **ExpansionHandler** | Expansion | Pack lifecycle, installation, credential model |
| 7 | **DspNetwork** | Node, Parameter, Connection, ContainerChild | Graph model, node creation/lookup, processing chain |
| 8 | **ScriptPanel** | Graphics, ScriptShader | Graphics only exists inside paint callback; ScriptShader is set on a panel |
| 9 | **UserPresetHandler** | MacroHandler, MidiAutomationHandler | Preset save/load lifecycle -- macros and MIDI automation are preset state components |
| 10 | **FixObjectFactory** | FixObjectArray, FixObjectStack | Layout definition model -- factory defines the typed schema |
| 11 | **Server** | Download | HTTP request lifecycle -- Download is a handle to an in-progress request |
| 12 | **FileSystem** | File | Folder model and constants that File operations assume |
| 13 | **Table** | TableProcessor | Lookup table data model that TableProcessor wraps |
| 14 | **SliderPackData** | ScriptSliderPack | Slider array data model that the UI component displays |
| 15 | **ScriptLookAndFeel** | ScriptComponent subclasses (soft) | LAF paint functions reference component properties |
