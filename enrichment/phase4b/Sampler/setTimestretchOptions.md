Sampler::setTimestretchOptions(JSON newOptions) -> undefined

Thread safety: UNSAFE -- allocates TimestretchOptions, modifies sampler state
Sets the timestretch configuration from a JSON object.
Mode values: "Disabled" (no stretching), "VoiceStart" (new voices use current
ratio), "TimeVariant" (all voices share ratio), "TempoSynced" (ratio from
sample length and tempo).
Properties: {Mode: string, Tonality: double (0.0-1.0),
  SkipLatency: bool, NumQuarters: double, SourceBPM: double,
  PreferredEngine: string}
SourceBPM (TempoSynced): when non-zero, numQuarters is derived from sample
  duration and supplied BPM; NumQuarters and the duration-guess fallback are
  only used when SourceBPM is zero.
Pair with:
  getTimestretchOptions -- read current configuration
  setTimestretchRatio -- set the stretch ratio

  ScriptingApi.cpp  Sampler::setTimestretchOptions()
    -> TimestretchOptions::fromJSON(newOptions)
