Audio modules are the building blocks of every HISE instrument. They form a tree structure rooted at a top-level Container (ModulatorSynthChain), with each module processing audio, MIDI, or control signals.

## Module Types

**[Sound Generators](/v2/reference/audio-modules/sound-generators/)** produce audio output and form the backbone of the signal chain. They host MIDI processor, modulation, and effect chains.

**[MIDI Processors](/v2/reference/audio-modules/midi-processors/)** transform, filter, or generate MIDI events before they reach the sound generator's voice rendering.

**[Modulators](/v2/reference/audio-modules/modulators/)** generate control signals in the range 0.0 to 1.0 that modulate gain, pitch, and effect parameters. Three subtypes cover different timing needs: voice start, time variant, and envelope.

**[Effects](/v2/reference/audio-modules/effects/)** process audio after generation. They operate at master, monophonic, or polyphonic scope depending on whether they need per-voice state.

## Reading the Pseudocode

## Common Concepts

All audio modules share these features inherited from the `Processor` base class.

### Module Tree

Modules form a hierarchical tree. A sound generator contains MIDI processors, modulators, and effects as child processors. Container modules (ModulatorSynthChain, SynthGroup) hold multiple sound generators in parallel.

### Processor ID

Every module has a unique string ID used to identify it in the module tree and reference it from scripts. Changing a Processor ID will break existing script references.

> [!Tip:IDE Workflow] Right-click a module's top bar in the HISE IDE to copy its XML to the clipboard or generate a script reference declaration that you can paste into a Script Processor's `onInit` callback.

### Parameters

Modules expose numbered parameters via `setAttribute()` / `getAttribute()`. Each module type defines its own parameter enum. Parameters accept float values and can be automated by the host DAW.

### Bypass

Any module can be bypassed via `setBypassed()`. Effects use a soft bypass with a short crossfade to avoid clicks.

### State Persistence

Module state can be exported as XML (ValueTree) and restored. From scripts, use `Processor.exportState()` and `Processor.restoreState()` with base64-encoded strings to save and restore processor snapshots.

### Scripting Access

Modules are accessed from HiseScript using typed `get*()` methods on the `Synth` namespace. These must be called in `onInit` and stored as `const var` for reuse across callbacks:

```javascript
// Base class references (onInit only)
const var fx      = Synth.getEffect("Delay1");
const var mod     = Synth.getModulator("LFO1");
const var mp      = Synth.getMidiProcessor("Arpeggiator1");
const var child   = Synth.getChildSynth("SubBass");
const var sampler = Synth.getSampler("MainSampler");

// Typed interface references for special data access
const var table   = Synth.getTableProcessor("VeloTable");
const var audio   = Synth.getAudioSampleProcessor("Looper1");
const var slider  = Synth.getSliderPackProcessor("LFOSteps");
const var matrix  = Synth.getRoutingMatrix("MasterChain");
```

Use `setAttribute()` to change parameters, `setIntensity()` / `setBipolar()` for modulator-specific properties (see [Modulators](/v2/reference/audio-modules/modulators/#common-parameters)), and `setBypassed()` to toggle bypass state.
