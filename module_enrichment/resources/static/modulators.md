title: Modulators
description: All HISE modulator modules - signal model, targets, parameters, and module list
---

Modulators generate control signals that scale parameters such as gain, pitch, and effect amounts. They are grouped into three subtypes based on their timing behaviour.

## Modulation Signal

All modulators produce a value in the normalised range **0.0 to 1.0**. How this value is applied depends on the chain mode:

- **Gain mode** - the modulation value is multiplied with the target. A value of 1.0 means no change, 0.0 means silence. Multiple modulators in the same chain are multiplied together.
- **Pitch mode** - the modulation value is converted to a bipolar range and added to the pitch signal.
- **Pan mode** - the modulation value is converted to a bipolar range and controls stereo panning.

The exact formula for each mode is shown in the `applyIntensity` function in the pseudocode blocks below.

Modulation signals in HISE are downsampled by a configurable factor (`HISE_CONTROL_RATE_DOWNSAMPLING_FACTOR`, default: 8). This means modulators update once every 8 samples rather than at full audio rate, significantly reducing CPU usage. For complex modulation synth projects where higher resolution is needed, this can be set to 1 for sample-accurate modulation.

## Modulation Targets

Modulators are placed inside **modulation chains** that belong to a parent module:

- **Gain Modulation** - scales the output volume. Uses multiplicative (Gain) mode.
- **Pitch Modulation** - modulates the pitch of all voices. Uses additive (Pitch) mode with bipolar range.
- **Effect parameter chains** - some effects expose modulatable parameters with their own modulation chains.
- **Global modulators** - modulators placed inside a [Global Modulator Container]($MODULES.GlobalModulatorContainer$) can be shared across multiple targets using Global Voice Start, Global Time Variant, or Global Envelope proxy modules.

## Common Parameters

All modulators share these properties from the `Modulation` base class.

> [!Warning:Scripting API] Intensity and Bipolar are **not** regular parameters - they do not go through the `setAttribute()` system. In scripts, use `Modulator.setIntensity()` and `Modulator.setBipolar()` instead.

      - { name: Bipolar, desc: "Converts the output from unipolar (0 to 1) to bipolar (-1 to +1). Automatically enabled in Pitch chains. Set via `setBipolar()`.", range: "Off / On", default: "Off (Gain) / On (Pitch)" }

## Voice Start Modulators

Compute a single value at note-on that remains constant for the lifetime of the voice. Use them for velocity-to-volume mapping, per-note randomisation, or any modulation that does not need to change after the note starts.

```
// Voice Start Modulator

    rawValue = calculate(noteNumber, velocity)

## Time Variant Modulators

Produce a continuous monophonic signal that updates every audio block, shared across all voices. Use them for LFOs, MIDI CC mapping, and macro parameters where per-voice independence is not needed.

## Envelope Modulators

Produce per-voice signals that evolve over time, typically with attack/release stages. Envelope modulators control voice lifetime - when the envelope returns to zero after release, the voice is terminated. Every sound generator needs at least one envelope in its Gain chain.

    calculate:
      desc: "Computes the raw envelope value (0.0 to 1.0) for this voice and audio block. Implementation varies per module (e.g. AHDSR stages, table lookup, scriptnode network)."

```
// Envelope Modulator
// polyphonic, updates every audio block per voice

onNoteOn(voice):
    startEnvelope(voice)

onNoteOff(voice):
    startRelease(voice)

process(voice, blockSize):
    rawValue = calculate(voice, blockSize)
    value = applyIntensity(rawValue)

    if value == 0 and inRelease(voice):
        killVoice(voice)
```
