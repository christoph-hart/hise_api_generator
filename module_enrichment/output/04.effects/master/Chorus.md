    right: "Both channels share the same internal LFO phase, so there is no inherent stereo widening from phase differences"
    explanation: "The stereo effect comes only from different feedback histories in each channel's delay buffer. For stronger stereo widening, consider using two instances with different settings or a scriptnode alternative."
  - wrong: "Setting Feedback to 0.5 expecting moderate feedback"
    right: "At Feedback=0.5 the internal feedback is actually zero. Values below 0.5 produce negative feedback, values above 0.5 produce positive feedback."
    explanation: "The Feedback parameter maps 0-1 to an internal range of -0.95 to +0.95. The crossover point at 0.5 means zero feedback."

  Chorus (MasterEffect)

  Simple stereo chorus with an internal parabolic LFO modulating a delay line. The wet/dry mix is hardcoded at 47% wet / 53% dry and cannot be adjusted. Both channels share the same LFO phase (no stereo offset).

  Signal flow:
    audio in -> write (input + feedback * lastDelayed) to buffer -> read at LFO-modulated position (linear interpolation) -> subtractive mix (53% dry - 47% wet) -> audio out

  CPU: low, monophonic (MasterEffect).

  Parameters:
    Rate (0-100%, default 30%) - LFO speed, approximately 0.01-10 Hz logarithmic
    Width (0-100%, default 43%) - modulation depth controlling pitch variation intensity
    Feedback (0-100%, default 30%) - maps to internal -0.95 to +0.95 range. Default gives negative feedback (-0.38).
    Delay (0-100%, default 100%) - shifts the modulation centre point. At 100%, full depth range is used.

  When to use:
    Quick chorus thickening effect with minimal CPU. For more control over stereo width, wet/dry mix, or LFO shape, use the scriptnode equivalent.

  Common mistakes:
    No stereo widening from LFO phase offset - both channels share the same phase.
    Feedback=0.5 is zero feedback, not moderate. Below 0.5 = negative, above 0.5 = positive.
    Wet/dry mix is fixed at 47/53 and cannot be changed.

  Custom equivalent:
    scriptnode HardcodedFX: modulated delay line with configurable LFO, stereo offset, and mix.

![Chorus screenshot](/images/v2/reference/audio-modules/chorus.png)

A simple stereo chorus effect that uses an internal parabolic LFO to modulate a delay line. The modulated delay creates the characteristic pitch variation and thickening associated with chorus effects. The wet signal is subtractively mixed with the dry signal at a fixed ratio that cannot be adjusted.

The Chorus is lightweight and straightforward but has limited control compared to a scriptnode equivalent. Both channels share the same LFO phase (no stereo offset), the wet/dry mix is fixed, and the Feedback parameter uses an unusual mapping where 0.5 equals zero feedback.

groups:
  - label: Modulation
    params:
      - { name: Rate, desc: "Controls the speed of the internal LFO. Maps logarithmically to approximately 0.01-10 Hz. Below 1%, the LFO is frozen and the chorus becomes a static delay.", range: "0 - 100%", default: "30%" }
      - { name: Width, desc: "Controls the depth of the delay modulation, which determines the intensity of the pitch variation. Higher values create a more pronounced chorus effect. The maximum modulation depth is approximately 45ms at 44.1kHz.", range: "0 - 100%", default: "43%" }
  - label: Delay
    params:
      - { name: Feedback, desc: "Controls the amount of delayed signal fed back into the buffer. Maps to an internal range of -0.95 to +0.95: values below 50% produce negative feedback, 50% is zero feedback, and values above 50% produce positive feedback. The default of 30% gives a negative feedback of -0.38.", range: "0 - 100%", default: "30%" }
      - { name: Delay, desc: "Shifts the centre point of the delay modulation. At 100% (default), the modulation sweeps from zero to the maximum depth set by Width. Lower values offset the modulation range upward, increasing the minimum delay time.", range: "0 - 100%", default: "100%" }

## Notes

The wet/dry mix is fixed at approximately 53% dry and 47% wet. There is no Mix parameter to adjust this ratio.

Both channels share the same internal LFO phase. The stereo effect comes only from the different feedback histories accumulated in each channel's delay buffer, not from LFO phase offset.

The delay buffer holds 2048 samples. At 44.1kHz, the maximum modulation depth is approximately 45ms.

When Rate is set below approximately 1%, the LFO is frozen and the phase is reset, producing a static delay effect.
