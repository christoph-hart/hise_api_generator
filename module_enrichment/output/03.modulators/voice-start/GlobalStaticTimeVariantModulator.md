  Global Static Time Variant Modulator (VoiceStartModulator)

  Captures the current value of a TimeVariantModulator from a Global Modulator Container at the moment a note starts. Despite connecting to a continuous source, it behaves as a VoiceStartModulator - each voice gets a fixed value frozen at note-on.

  Signal flow:
    Source last block value (from container) -> optional table lookup -> optional inversion (1 - value) -> modulation output (constant per voice)

  CPU: very low. Single value read per voice start event.

  Parameters:
    UseTable (Off/On, default Off) - enables lookup table for value transformation
    Inverted (Off/On, default Off) - inverts the output (1 - value)

  When to use:
    When you want per-voice variation derived from the current state of a continuous modulator (e.g., an LFO). Each note captures the LFO's value at the moment it is triggered, creating timing-dependent per-voice differences.

  Common mistakes:
    Value is block-quantised, not sample-accurate.
    Confusing with GlobalTimeVariantModulator (continuous tracking vs snapshot).

    source GlobalModulatorContainer - hosts the source modulator
    disambiguation GlobalTimeVariantModulator - continuous tracking instead of snapshot
    disambiguation GlobalVoiceStartModulator - reads from VoiceStart sources, not TimeVariant

![Global Static Time Variant Modulator screenshot](/images/v2/reference/audio-modules/globalstatictimevariantmodulator.png)

The Global Static Time Variant Modulator captures the current value of a time-variant modulator (such as an LFO) from a Global Modulator Container at the moment a note starts. Despite connecting to a continuous source, it behaves as a voice-start modulator - each voice receives a fixed value frozen at note-on time.

This creates per-voice variation based on when each note is triggered. For example, connecting to a shared LFO means each note captures a different phase of the LFO cycle, producing timing-dependent differences between voices. An optional lookup table and inversion toggle allow local transformation of the captured value.

## Notes

The captured value is the source modulator's last computed block output, not an interpolated value at the exact note-on timestamp. For fast-moving sources like LFOs, this means the captured value is quantised to audio block boundaries. This is sufficient for most musical applications but should be understood when precise timing matters.

When disconnected (no source selected), the modulator returns 1.0 (pass-through in gain mode).

This module is often confused with the Global Time Variant Modulator. The key difference: this module freezes the source value at note-on (per-voice, constant), while the Global Time Variant Modulator continuously tracks the source (monophonic, changing). Choose this module when you want each note to capture a different snapshot of a shared modulation source.
