  Effect Slot (MasterEffect)

  A container that hosts a single swappable child effect. The hosted effect can be changed at runtime, making it useful for dynamic signal chains where the user selects from a list of effects. When empty, audio passes through unchanged.

  Signal flow:
    audio in -> [if effect loaded] child effect processing -> audio out
    audio in -> [if empty] -> audio out (passthrough)

  CPU: negligible (wrapper overhead only), monophonic. Actual CPU depends on the hosted effect.

  Parameters: none (all parameters belong to the hosted child effect).

  Allowed child effects: all master effects and monophonic effects except Route Effect and Effect Slot (no nesting).

  When to use:
    Building dynamic effect chains where the user can swap between different effects at runtime. Commonly used with scripting to create switchable effect racks.

  Common mistakes:
    No crossfade on swap - the transition is instantaneous.
    Only master/monophonic effects allowed, no polyphonic effects or nested slots.
    setEffect() requires the type name (e.g. "SimpleReverb"), not the instance name from the module tree.
    HardcodedMasterFX with more than 2 channels cannot be loaded into an Effect Slot.
    UI controls are not automatically updated after a slot swap - re-read attribute values manually.

  Tips:
    Use Engine.addModuleStateToUserPreset() to persist the loaded effect and its parameters across user presets.
    setBypassed() does not work on SlotFX references - use Synth.getEffect() to get a second reference.
    The Filter effect type is excluded from the Effect Slot dropdown and cannot be loaded via setEffect().

![Effect Slot screenshot](/images/v2/reference/audio-modules/slotfx.png)

The Effect Slot hosts a single child effect that can be swapped at runtime. It is the standard building block for dynamic signal chains where the user selects from a list of available effects. When no effect is loaded, audio passes through unchanged.

The slot accepts all master effects and monophonic effects, excluding Route Effect and other Effect Slots (no nesting). MIDI events, bypass state, and monophonic voice lifecycle are all forwarded to the hosted effect. The slot itself has no parameters - all controls belong to the child.

### Effect Swapping

When an effect is swapped, the transition is instantaneous at the next processing boundary. There is no crossfade between the old and new effects, which may produce a brief audio discontinuity if the swap occurs during playback.

Two Effect Slots can exchange their hosted effects atomically using the swap operation, which is useful for reordering effects in a dynamic chain.

### Empty State

An empty slot always contains an Empty effect internally rather than being truly null. Clearing the slot replaces the current effect with a fresh Empty instance.

### Bypass Delegation

Bypass is fully delegated to the hosted effect. Bypassing the Effect Slot forwards the bypass state to whatever effect is currently loaded.

:::{.warning}
`setBypassed()` does not work when called on a SlotFX scripting reference [1](https://forum.hise.audio/topic/5947). As a workaround, obtain a second reference to the same module using `Synth.getEffect()` and call `setBypassed()` on that reference instead.
:::

### Persisting State Across Presets

By default, user presets do not save which effect is loaded in an Effect Slot or its parameter values. Call `Engine.addModuleStateToUserPreset(moduleId)` in onInit for each Effect Slot to include its full state in user preset data [2](https://forum.hise.audio/topic/13353) [3](https://forum.hise.audio/topic/13661).

### Excluded Effect Types

The built-in Filter module is excluded from the Effect Slot type list and cannot be loaded via `setEffect()` [4](https://forum.hise.audio/topic/2536). Use a Script FX wrapping the desired filter behaviour as a workaround.
