  - wrong: "Setting Mix to 0.5 expecting a subtle effect"

  Phase FX (MasterEffect)

  Phaser effect using 6 cascaded allpass filters with feedback to create sweeping frequency notches. Requires external modulation (e.g. LFO) in the Phase Modulation chain to produce sweep movement - has no internal LFO.

  Signal flow:
    audio in -> [input + feedback * prevOutput] -> 6x allpass cascade -> sum with input -> dry/wet mix -> audio out

  CPU: medium, monophonic (MasterEffect).

  Parameters:
    Frequency1 (20-20000 Hz, default 400 Hz) - lower bound of the sweep range
    Frequency2 (20-20000 Hz, default 1600 Hz) - upper bound of the sweep range
    Feedback (0-100%, default 70%) - resonance intensity around the allpass cascade. Scaled by 0.99 for safety.
    Mix (0-100%, default 100%) - linear dry/wet crossfade

  Modulation chains:
    Phase Modulation - sweeps allpass frequencies between Frequency1 and Frequency2. Audio-rate capable. 0 = Frequency1, 1 = Frequency2.

  When to use:
    Classic phaser sweep effects. Add an LFO to the Phase Modulation chain for auto-sweep, or use an envelope for dynamic phasing.

  Common mistakes:
    No internal LFO - must add a modulator to the Phase Modulation chain for sweep.
    Mix defaults to 100% wet.

![Phase FX screenshot](/images/v2/reference/audio-modules/phasefx.png)

Phase FX creates sweeping frequency notches by passing the signal through a cascade of six allpass filters with feedback. The sweep position is controlled entirely by the Phase Modulation chain - there is no internal LFO, so you must add a modulator (typically an LFO) to create the characteristic phaser sweep.

The two Frequency parameters define the sweep range: the modulation chain interpolates the allpass filter frequencies between Frequency1 and Frequency2. Feedback controls how pronounced the notches are, creating stronger resonance at higher values.

## Notes

Phase FX has no internal LFO. Without modulators in the Phase Modulation chain, the phaser produces a static notch pattern at whatever position the constant modulation value sets. To create the classic phaser sweep, add an LFO modulator to the Phase Modulation chain.

Frequency1 and Frequency2 are smoothed with a 50ms ramp to prevent clicks when changed via automation or scripting.
