commonMistakes:

    wrong: "Setting Gain and expecting it to affect a low-pass or high-pass filter mode"

    explanation: "For all other filter types, the Gain parameter has no audible effect. Switch to a shelf or peak mode before adjusting Gain."
  - title: "Use CurveEq for master bus"
    wrong: "Adding the module to shape the master output signal"
    right: "Use CurveEq or a monophonic effect for master bus filtering"
    explanation: "PolyphonicFilter is a per-voice effect. When no polyphonic modulators are connected it falls back to monophonic processing, but CurveEq is designed for that purpose and offers multiple bands."
  - title: "StateVariablePeak and LadderFourPoleHP broken"
    wrong: "Selecting StateVariablePeak or LadderFourPoleHP mode and expecting the filter to change"
    right: "These two modes are non-functional - the previously selected filter type remains active"
    explanation: "StateVariablePeak (index 11) and LadderFourPoleHP (index 16) are listed in the mode selector but do not switch the filter. Avoid these modes."

  PolyphonicFilter (VoiceEffect)

  Per-voice filter with 18 selectable modes (LP, HP, shelf, peak, SVF, Moog, ladder, allpass, ring mod, one-pole). Automatically switches between per-voice and monophonic processing based on whether any modulation chain contains polyphonic modulators. Default: StateVariableLP at 20000 Hz (transparent).

  Signal flow:
    audio in (per-voice) -> combine frequency modulation (normalise + bipolar offset + freq mod scale) -> update coefficients if changed -> filter process (topology selected by Mode) -> audio out

  CPU: medium baseline, scales linearly with voice count. MoogLP and Ladder modes are more expensive.

  Parameters:
    Frequency (20-20000 Hz, default 20000 Hz) - cutoff/centre frequency. Default passes all audible frequencies.
    Q (0.3-8.0, default 1.0) - resonance/bandwidth.
    Gain (-18 to 18 dB, default 0 dB) - only affects LowShelf, HighShelf, and Peak modes.
    Mode (0-17, default 6/StateVariableLP) - selects filter type. Modes 11 (StateVariablePeak) and 16 (LadderFourPoleHP) are non-functional.
    Quality (0-4096, default 512) - has no effect on processing.
    BipolarIntensity (-1.0 to 1.0, default 0.0) - scales the bipolar frequency modulation offset.

  Modulation chains:
    Frequency Modulation (gain mode) - scales normalised cutoff frequency. Per-voice when polyphonic modulators present.
    Gain Modulation (gain mode) - scales filter gain for shelf/peak modes.
    Bipolar Freq Modulation (offset mode) - adds signed offset to normalised frequency before standard frequency modulation.
    Q Modulation (gain mode) - scales the Q value.

  Filter modes:
    0=LowPass, 1=HighPass, 2=LowShelf, 3=HighShelf, 4=Peak, 5=ResoLow, 6=StateVariableLP, 7=StateVariableHP, 8=MoogLP, 9=OnePoleLowPass, 10=OnePoleHighPass, 11=StateVariablePeak(broken), 12=StateVariableNotch, 13=StateVariableBandPass, 14=Allpass, 15=LadderFourPoleLP, 16=LadderFourPoleHP(broken), 17=RingMod

  When to use:
    Per-voice filtering in polyphonic instruments. Connect an envelope to the Frequency Modulation chain for classic filter sweeps per voice.

  Common mistakes:
    Gain parameter only works with shelf/peak modes.
    StateVariablePeak and LadderFourPoleHP modes are non-functional.
    Quality parameter has no effect.

![Filter screenshot](/images/v2/reference/audio-modules/polyphonicfilter.png)

A per-voice filter effect with 18 selectable filter types including low-pass, high-pass, shelving, peak, state variable, Moog ladder, and ring modulation modes. Each active voice runs its own independent filter instance, making it suitable for classic polyphonic filter sweeps driven by envelopes or LFOs.

The module automatically switches between per-voice and monophonic processing. When any modulation chain contains a polyphonic modulator, audio is filtered independently per voice. When all modulators are monophonic, the summed signal is processed as a single stream with coefficient updates every 64 samples. The default settings (StateVariableLP at 20000 Hz) pass all audible frequencies, so the filter is effectively transparent until you lower the Frequency or change the Mode.

### Frequency Modulation

The two frequency modulation paths interact in a specific order: the Frequency value is normalised to a 0-1 range, the bipolar offset is added, and then the Frequency Modulation chain multiplies the result. The standard Frequency Modulation chain scales from ~20 Hz up to the Frequency knob value - it does not modulate around the set frequency. To modulate around a centre frequency, use the Bipolar Frequency chain instead. [1]($FORUM_REF.2749$)

### CPU and Polyphonic Processing

The module automatically detects whether polyphonic processing is needed based on the modulator types in its chains. Adding even a single polyphonic modulator (e.g., velocity) to any chain forces all voices to be processed independently, significantly increasing CPU cost. [2]($FORUM_REF.404$)

### Non-Functional Elements

The `Quality` parameter is vestigial - it is stored and appears in the interface but does not affect processing. Two filter modes are non-functional: **StateVariablePeak** (index 11) and **LadderFourPoleHP** (index 16). Selecting either does not change the active filter. Use Peak (index 4) or StateVariableHP (index 7) as alternatives.
