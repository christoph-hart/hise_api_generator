  Script FX (Effect/MasterEffect)

  Monophonic master effect that processes stereo audio through a scriptnode DSP network. Also supports HISEScript processBlock callbacks as a fallback when no network is loaded. All parameters are dynamic - they come from the loaded network.

  Signal flow:
    audio in (L/R) -> [network loaded?] -> ExtraModChains modulate network params -> network process -> audio out (L/R)
                                        -> script processBlock -> audio out (L/R)

  CPU: depends on loaded network, monophonic
    Framework overhead is negligible.

  Parameters:
    All parameters are dynamic and come from the loaded scriptnode network.
    No fixed parameters (offset = 0).

  Modulation chains:
    Extra Modulation Chains (default 0, configurable via HISE_NUM_SCRIPTNODE_FX_MODS) - see Audio Modules modulators reference for connection mode details

  Channel configuration:
    Standard scriptnode channel configuration (default stereo, up to 16). See Audio Modules sound-generators reference for details.

  Complex data types and parameter exposure:
    No fixed parameters (offset = 0). See Audio Modules index Custom section for complex data types, parameter exposure, and configuration table.

  When to use:
    Use ScriptFX to host a custom effect built in scriptnode during development. For exported plugins, switch to HardcodedMasterFX with the compiled network.

  Common mistakes:
    Forgetting to compile the network before export.
    Having both script and network code - network always takes priority.
    Forgetting to set HISE_NUM_SCRIPTNODE_FX_MODS when needing extra mod slots.

![Script FX screenshot](/images/v2/reference/audio-modules/scriptfx.png)

Script FX hosts a scriptnode DSP network as a monophonic master effect. It processes the full stereo output bus, making it suitable for insert effects like EQ, compression, distortion, or reverb built in scriptnode. Parameters declared in the network are automatically exposed to the module tree and can be controlled from HISEScript or connected to UI components.

The module also supports a legacy HISEScript mode with `prepareToPlay` and `processBlock` callbacks for simple audio processing without a scriptnode network. When a network is loaded, it always takes priority over the script callbacks.

### Loading a Network

Create a scriptnode network in the `onInit` callback by calling `Engine.createDspNetwork("NetworkName")`. This creates a new network or loads an existing one from the `DspNetworks/Networks/` folder, where networks are stored as `.xml` files.

The network operates in monophonic mode — it receives the full mixed audio bus and processes it as a single stream. Use monophonic containers in the network; polyphonic containers are not applicable here.

Switching networks at runtime is possible by calling `Engine.createDspNetwork()` again with a different name. However, this is a heavyweight operation that reinitialises the entire DSP graph and should not be done during audio playback. For preset-style switching, expose network parameters and change those instead. Alternatively, use the `SlotFX` interface for managed effect switching.

### Modulation Chain Configuration

This module has no built-in Gain or Pitch modulation chains. Extra modulation slots are controlled by `HISE_NUM_SCRIPTNODE_FX_MODS` (default: 0). See [Scriptnode Modulation Bridge](/v2/reference/audio-modules/modulators/#scriptnode-modulation-bridge) for how extra modulation slots connect to network parameters.

### Channel Configuration

This module supports the standard scriptnode channel configuration. See [Scriptnode and Hardcoded Module Channels](/v2/reference/audio-modules/sound-generators/#scriptnode-and-hardcoded-module-channels).

### Parameter Exposure and Complex Data

This module has no fixed parameters — all network parameters start at index 0. See [Custom module hosting](/v2/reference/audio-modules/#custom) for parameter exposure, complex data types, and the configuration table.
