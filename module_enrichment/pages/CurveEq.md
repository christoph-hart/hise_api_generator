  Parametriq EQ (Effect/MasterEffect)

  A parametric equaliser with an unlimited number of dynamically managed filter bands and an optional FFT spectrum display. Bands are processed in series (cascaded) through the stereo signal. Each band has independent frequency, gain, Q, type, and enable controls.

  Signal flow:
    stereo in -> [64-sample sub-blocks] -> band 1 filter -> band 2 filter -> ... -> band N filter -> (optional FFT write) -> stereo out

  CPU: medium baseline (scales linearly with band count), monophonic.

  Per-band parameters:
    Gain (-18 to +18 dB, default 0 dB) - boost/cut. Only affects Low Shelf, High Shelf, Peak. No effect on LP/HP.
    Freq (20 - 20000 Hz, default 1500 Hz) - centre frequency.
    Q (0.3 - 8.0, default 1.0) - bandwidth/resonance. On LP/HP bands, the curve display responds to Q but the audio does not (one-pole filters).
    Type (Low Pass, High Pass, Low Shelf, High Shelf, Peak; default Peak) - filter algorithm.
    Enabled (On/Off, default On) - bypasses the individual band.

  Band management:
    Bands are dynamic - added/removed via editor UI or scripting.
    Scripting: setAttribute with flat indexing: bandIndex * BandOffset + parameterConstant.
    Constants: Gain (0), Freq (1), Q (2), Enabled (3), Type (4), BandOffset (5).
    exportState()/restoreState() serialise the full band configuration for EQ preset slots.
    Engine.addModuleStateToUserPreset() required to include EQ state in user presets.
    No built-in callback for band dragging - use attachToComponentMouseEvents() on the FloatingTile.

  Filter mode:
    Default: biquad with 280ms parameter smoothing (coefficient update every 64 samples).
    HISE_USE_SVF_FOR_CURVE_EQ=1: switches to SVF filters - eliminates zipper noise on automation, slightly different tonality. Requires recompile.

  Spectrum display:
    Optional FFT analyser, disabled by default. Rendered by DraggableFilterPanel FloatingTile.

  Common mistakes:
    Setting Gain on LP/HP bands has no effect.
    UI knobs with saveInPreset=true on EQ bands corrupt preset loading - use saveInPreset=false.
    CPU scales linearly with band count.

  Custom equivalent:
    scriptnode HardcodedFX: chain of biquad filter nodes with per-node modulation.

![Parametriq EQ screenshot](/images/v2/reference/audio-modules/curveeq.png)

The Parametriq EQ is a fully parametric equaliser with a dynamic number of filter bands and an optional FFT spectrum display. Unlike most HISE modules, it has no fixed parameters - bands are added and removed at runtime, each with independent control over frequency, gain, Q factor, filter type, and enable state.

All bands are processed in series: each band's output feeds the next, forming a cascaded filter chain. The order of bands matters, though in practice the audible difference from reordering is negligible for most EQ configurations. An optional spectrum analyser overlays the post-filter frequency content behind the filter curve display, providing real-time visual feedback.

### Band Management

Bands are managed dynamically. In the editor, double-click the filter curve display to add a band, or right-click an existing band to remove it. From HISEScript, use the `setDraggableFilterData()` and `getDraggableFilterData()` methods on the effect reference, or address individual band parameters with flat indexing:

```
// Example: set band 0's frequency to 2000 Hz
eq.setAttribute(0 * eq.BandOffset + eq.Freq, 2000.0);

// Example: set band 2's type to High Shelf (3)
eq.setAttribute(2 * eq.BandOffset + eq.Type, 3);
```

The available scripting constants are: `Gain` (0), `Freq` (1), `Q` (2), `Enabled` (3), `Type` (4), and `BandOffset` (5).

The complete band configuration can be serialised with `exportState()` and restored with `restoreState()`. This is the recommended approach for implementing named EQ preset slots (e.g., stored in a ComboBox or array of JSON objects). To include EQ band state in user presets, call `Engine.addModuleStateToUserPreset()` with the EQ module reference - the DraggableFilterPanel FloatingTile does not participate in user preset saving by default.

There is no built-in callback that fires when a user drags a band in the DraggableFilterPanel. To sync external UI controls (e.g., knobs showing a band's frequency or gain), attach a broadcaster to the FloatingTile's mouse events via `attachToComponentMouseEvents()` and read band values on drag and click events.

### Smoothing and Filter Mode

Each band uses biquad filters by default with 280ms parameter smoothing. Coefficients are updated every 64 samples, so rapid automation produces smooth transitions without audible stepping. There are no modulation chains - all parameter changes are applied directly.

Adding `HISE_USE_SVF_FOR_CURVE_EQ=1` to the project's Extra Definitions switches all bands from biquad to state-variable filters. SVF filters do not produce zipper noise when frequency, gain, or Q are changed in real time, making them preferable when bands will be automated or scripted to move. The tonal character differs slightly from the default biquad mode. This setting requires recompiling the plugin.

### Spectrum Analyser

The spectrum analyser is disabled by default to save CPU. It shows the post-filter output spectrum overlaid behind the filter curve. The analyser can be toggled from the editor toolbar.

### DraggableFilterPanel

The DraggableFilterPanel FloatingTile embeds the EQ display in custom interfaces. Its visual rendering is fully overridable via a local LookAndFeel object - use a local (not global) LAF to avoid issues with compile error recovery.

The module is automatically suspended when the input signal is silent.
