  Matrix Modulator (EnvelopeModulator)

  Combines multiple global modulators from a Global Modulator Container into a single modulation output via a connection matrix. Each connection has a mode (Scale/Add/Bipolar), intensity, and optional auxiliary source.

  Signal flow:
    Base value (smoothed) -> multiply by all Scale connections -> add all Add connections -> optional output range skew -> modulation output

  Combination formula: output = (baseValue * scaleMod1 * ... * scaleModN) + addMod1 + ... + addModM

  CPU: medium, scaling with number of connections. Per-sample smoothing of base value plus per-sample processing per connection.

  Parameters:
    Monophonic (Off/On, default dynamic) - skips inner node reset in monophonic mode
    Retrigger (Off/On, default On) - restarts on new note in monophonic mode
    Value (0-100%, default dynamic) - base value before connections are applied
    SmoothingTime (0-2000 ms, default 50 ms) - smoothing time for base value transitions

  Connection modes:
    Scale - multiplicative (multiplies against base value)
    Add - additive (offsets from base value)
    Bipolar - additive with bipolar range display

  When to use:
    When you need to combine multiple global modulators into a single modulation output with individual per-connection modes and intensities. More flexible than single-source Global*Modulator consumers.

  UI: ModulationMatrixPanel and ModulationMatrixControlPanel FloatingTiles.

  Macro controls:
    Assign the same matrixTargetId to multiple MatrixModulators and a UI knob to build unified macro controls.
    Without a MatrixModulator in the chain, matrixTargetId sends values only once per buffer (monophonic).
    Call setMatrixModulationProperties once in onInit before creating connections.

  Common mistakes:
    Requires a GlobalModulatorContainer with source modulators.
    Scale and Add modes have different combination order.
    matrixTargetId without a MatrixModulator in the chain loses polyphonic modulation.
    Mode comboboxes stay empty without calling setMatrixModulationProperties at init.

![Matrix Modulator screenshot](/images/v2/reference/audio-modules/matrixmodulator.png)

The Matrix Modulator combines multiple global modulators from a Global Modulator Container into a single modulation output. Unlike the single-source Global*Modulator consumers, this module provides a connection matrix where each connection has its own mode (Scale, Add, or Bipolar), intensity, and optional auxiliary source.

The base Value parameter sets the starting point. Scale connections multiply against it, then Add connections offset from the result. The smoothing parameter prevents clicks when the base value changes. When all connections are removed, the modulator automatically bypasses itself and outputs the base value directly.

### Connection Properties

Each connection in the matrix has:
- A source modulator (selected from the container's gain chain)
- A mode: Scale (multiplicative), Add (additive), or Bipolar (additive with bipolar range display)
- An intensity slider (-1 to 1)
- An optional auxiliary source with its own intensity
- A per-connection inversion toggle

Connections are created via the matrix table editor, drag-and-drop from the container, or the right-click popup menu. Scale connections are always processed before Add connections, regardless of the order they appear in the connection table.

### Macro Controls with matrixTargetId

Assigning the same `matrixTargetId` to several Matrix Modulators and to a UI control (such as a knob) causes that control to drive the Value parameter of all matching modulators simultaneously. This is the recommended way to build unified macro controls across multiple modulation targets. [3]($FORUM_REF.13203$)

When driving filter cutoff from a Matrix Modulator, use the FilterFreq or FilterFreq Logarithmic edit-range preset. Set the filter's frequency parameter to 20 kHz, then connect the UI knob to the Matrix Modulator's Value parameter. The connection wizard sets the knob range and suffixes automatically. [4]($FORUM_REF.13240$)

### CSS Styling

The matrix table columns can be styled using CSS ID selectors: `#sourceindex`, `#targetid`, `#mode`, `#inverted`, and `#plotter`. Each selector applies to both the header cell and every data cell in that column. The plotter column does not support `background` or `color` CSS properties to avoid the CPU overhead of real-time path rendering at 30 fps. [5]($FORUM_REF.13369$)
