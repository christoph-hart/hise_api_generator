  Macro Modulator (TimeVariantModulator)

  Bridges the macro control system to the modulation system. Listens to a macro control slot and outputs its value as a time-variant modulation signal with optional response curve shaping and smoothing.

  Signal flow:
    Macro slot value (0-1) -> table lookup (optional) -> smoother (per-sample at control rate) -> modulation output

  CPU: very low. Monophonic. Per-sample processing only when smoothing is active; constant-fill when converged.

  Parameters:
    MacroIndex (-1 to 7, default -1) - which macro slot to listen to. -1 = disconnected.
    SmoothTime (0-1000 ms, default 200 ms) - smoothing time for value transitions
    UseTable (Off/On, default Off) - enables a lookup table for custom response curves
    MacroValue (0-1, default 1.0) - internal write-only parameter driven by the macro system

  When to use:
    When you need sample-accurate macro control with smoothing or custom response curves. The standard macro control protocol operates at block rate; this modulator provides per-sample interpolation and table-based reshaping.

  Common mistakes:
    Default MacroIndex is -1 (disconnected) - must assign a slot.
    Table lookup happens before smoothing, not after.

  Custom equivalent:
    scriptnode Modulator with global cable and smoothing node.

The Macro Modulator listens to a macro control slot and converts its value into a time-variant modulation signal. It provides two features beyond what the standard macro control protocol offers: per-sample smoothing to prevent zipper noise on fast value changes, and an optional lookup table for custom response curves.

Place this modulator in any modulation chain where you want a macro knob to control a parameter with smooth, click-free transitions. The table allows non-linear mappings - for example, an exponential curve for volume fades or a stepped curve for discrete value jumps.

## Notes

The Macro Modulator does not respond to MIDI events. It receives values exclusively from the macro control system. When disconnected (MacroIndex = -1), a fresh instance outputs a constant 1.0, which acts as a pass-through in gain modulation mode.

The table lookup is applied before smoothing. This means the smoother operates on the post-table value, not the raw macro value. If the table produces a stepped output, the smoother will still interpolate between the steps, softening the transitions.

When the smoothing time is 0, value changes take effect immediately with no interpolation. For fast automation, a small smoothing time (10-50 ms) prevents audible artifacts without adding noticeable latency.

After disconnecting from a macro slot, the modulator retains whatever value it had at the moment of disconnection. It does not reset to 1.0 - only a newly created instance starts at the default.
