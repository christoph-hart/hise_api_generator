  Random Modulator (Modulator/VoiceStartModulator)

  Generates an independent random value (0-1) for each voice at note-on. An optional lookup table reshapes the probability distribution without changing the output range.

  Signal flow:
    noteOn -> random float [0, 1) -> [table lookup] -> modulation out

  CPU: negligible, polyphonic (runs once per voice on note-on)

  Parameters:
    UseTable (Off/On, default Off) - enables a lookup table that remaps the uniform random distribution into a custom probability curve

  When to use:
    Add controlled randomness to any modulatable parameter - sample start offset, pitch detune, gain variation, filter cutoff jitter. Enable UseTable to bias the distribution towards specific value ranges.

  Common mistakes:
    Output is purely random with no MIDI input - it does not read velocity or note number.
    UseTable reshapes the distribution within 0-1, it does not change the output range.
    Each voice gets an independent value - simultaneous voices are uncorrelated.

  Custom equivalent:
    hisescript via ScriptVoiceStartModulator: use Math.random() in onVoiceStart.

![Random Modulator screenshot](/images/v2/reference/audio-modules/random.png)

The Random Modulator generates an independent random value between 0 and 1 for each voice at note-on. It ignores all MIDI data - the output is purely random regardless of velocity, note number, or any other event property. Typical uses include sample start offset variation, subtle pitch detune, gain humanisation, and filter cutoff jitter.

Enabling **UseTable** activates a curve editor that reshapes the probability distribution. The random value becomes the X position in the table and the Y value becomes the output. Flat regions in the table concentrate probability towards those output values, while steep regions spread it. With the table disabled (the default), the distribution is uniform.

### Scripting with Tables

The Random module implements the TableProcessor interface. To manipulate the table from script, obtain a reference with `Synth.getTableProcessor()`. If you also need access to the modulator API (e.g. `setAttribute`, `getCurrentLevel`), create a second reference with `Synth.getModulator()` - both point to the same module but expose different APIs.

```javascript
const var randomTable = Synth.getTableProcessor("Random Modulator");
const var randomMod   = Synth.getModulator("Random Modulator");

// Enable the table via the modulator reference
randomMod.setAttribute(randomMod.UseTable, 1);

// Manipulate the curve via the table processor reference
randomTable.setTablePoint(0, 0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5);
```
