commonMistakes:

    right: "Use one of the registered modes: Linear, Atan, Sin, Asinh, TanCos, Chebyshev 1-3, Curve, or Asymmetrical Curve"
    explanation: "These modes are valid in ShapeFX but are not registered in Polyshape FX. Selecting them silently gives Linear passthrough with no audible effect."
  - wrong: "Enabling oversampling with high polyphony and wondering about CPU spikes"
    right: "Reserve oversampling for patches with moderate voice counts, or reduce polyphony when oversampling is on"
    explanation: "Each voice has its own oversampler instance. At 4x oversampling with 16 voices, the shaping function runs 64x more than a single non-oversampled voice."

  Polyshape FX (VoiceEffect)

  A polyphonic waveshaper that processes each voice independently. Provides 10 shaping modes including mathematical curves and two user-defined table lookups. Includes a modulatable drive stage, optional 4x oversampling, DC bias, and automatic output compensation.

  Signal flow (per voice):
    audio in -> drive * modulation -> bias -> [oversample 4x up] -> waveshaper(Mode) -> [oversample 4x down] -> drive-dependent attenuation -> [DC removal] -> audio out

  CPU: low baseline per voice (no oversampling). 4x oversampling roughly quadruples cost per voice. Scales linearly with active voice count.

  Parameters:
    Drive (0 - 60 dB, default 0 dB) - distortion drive amount, modulatable at audio rate
    Mode (0 - 33 discrete, default 1: Linear) - shaping function selector (10 active modes, unregistered modes give Linear passthrough)
    Oversampling (Off/On, default Off) - enables 4x oversampling for reduced aliasing
    Bias (0 - 100%, default 0%) - DC offset before shaping for asymmetric distortion

  Modulation chains:
    Drive Modulation (audio-rate, per-voice) - scales the drive amount from unity (mod=0) to full drive (mod=1)

  Available modes: Linear (1), Atan (2), Sin (4), Asinh (5), TanCos (9), Chebyshev 1 (10), Chebyshev 2 (11), Chebyshev 3 (12), Curve (32), Asymmetrical Curve (33). All other indices give Linear passthrough.

  When to use:
    Per-voice distortion, saturation, or waveshaping where each voice needs independent processing. Use Curve/Asymmetrical Curve for custom transfer functions. Use ShapeFX instead for monophonic bus processing with filtering and dry/wet mix.

  Common mistakes:
    Unregistered modes (Tanh, Saturate, Square, SquareRoot) silently give Linear. Oversampling cost scales with voice count.

  Custom equivalent:
    scriptnode HardcodedPolyFX with waveshaper and oversampling nodes.

![Polyshape FX screenshot](/images/v2/reference/audio-modules/polyshapefx.png)

Polyshape FX is a polyphonic waveshaper that processes each voice independently through a nonlinear shaping function. It provides 10 active shaping modes - 8 mathematical curves and 2 user-defined table lookups - with a modulatable drive stage and optional 4x oversampling for reduced aliasing. Unlike its monophonic counterpart Shape FX, it has no pre-shaper filtering, no dry/wet mix, no bit reduction, and no autogain. The output is always fully wet with automatic drive-dependent level compensation.

The drive parameter accepts audio-rate modulation, allowing per-voice dynamic control of the distortion intensity. The two table-based modes (Curve and Asymmetrical Curve) use separate lookup tables edited in the module's panel: Curve applies symmetric shaping (same curve for positive and negative signal), while Asymmetrical Curve allows different shaping for each polarity.

## Notes

The drive and bias application order differs by mode. Sin and TanCos apply drive first then add bias, while all other modes add bias first then multiply by drive. This means the same Drive and Bias settings produce different tonal results depending on the selected mode.

The post-shaping output compensation is not the same as Shape FX's autogain. Polyshape FX uses a simple drive-dependent divisor that provides mild level reduction at high drive values, rather than computing a static inverse from the transfer function.

Modes 3 (Tanh), 6 (Saturate), 7 (Square), and 8 (SquareRoot) are visible in the Mode range but are not registered in this module. Selecting them gives Linear passthrough with no audible shaping. These modes are functional in Shape FX but not in Polyshape FX.

The Curve mode (32) uses Table 0, which maps absolute input amplitude to output (symmetric around zero). The Asymmetrical Curve mode (33) uses Table 1, which maps the full -1 to +1 input range, allowing different shaping for positive and negative signal halves.
