     wrong: "Setting BypassFilters to On and using bias, then getting DC offset in the output"
     right: "Keep BypassFilters off when using non-zero bias values"
    explanation: "The DC removal filter is tied to BypassFilters. When filters are bypassed, the DC offset introduced by BiasLeft/BiasRight persists in the output, which can cause headroom issues downstream."
   - title: "High oversampling is CPU expensive"
     wrong: "Using high Oversampling values on multiple instances"
     right: "Use 2x or 4x oversampling, or apply higher factors to a single critical instance"
    explanation: "16x oversampling processes the shaping function at 16 times the sample rate, significantly increasing CPU usage. The quality improvement diminishes above 4x for most shaping modes."

  Shape FX (MasterEffect)

  A monophonic waveshaper with selectable shaping modes, pre-shaper filtering, DC bias, bit reduction, oversampling, autogain, and dry/wet mix. Provides 14 shaping functions including mathematical curves and user-defined table lookups.

  Signal flow:
    audio in -> dry copy -> [HP + LP filters] -> gain -> bias -> [soft limiter] -> [oversample up] -> waveshaper -> [bitcrusher] -> [oversample down] -> [DC removal] -> [autogain] -> mix with dry -> audio out

  CPU: low baseline (1x oversampling). Oversampling scales cost significantly (high at 16x). Monophonic.

  Parameters:
    Pre-Shaper Filtering:
      HighPass (20 - 8000 Hz, default 20 Hz) - high-pass cutoff before shaping
      LowPass (200 - 20000 Hz, default 20000 Hz) - low-pass cutoff before shaping
      BypassFilters (Off/On, default Off) - bypasses HP, LP, and DC removal together
    Input Stage:
      Gain (0 - 60 dB, default 0 dB) - input gain before shaping
      BiasLeft (-1.0 - 1.0, default 0.0) - DC offset on left channel
      BiasRight (-1.0 - 1.0, default 0.0) - DC offset on right channel
      LimitInput (Off/On, default On) - soft limiter before shaping
    Shaping:
      Mode (0 - 33 discrete, default 1: Linear) - shaping function selector
      Drive (0 - 100%, default 0%) - vestigial, has no effect
      Oversampling (1x/2x/4x/8x/16x, default 1x) - anti-aliasing quality
      Reduce (0 - 14, default 0) - bit reduction depth
    Output:
      Autogain (Off/On, default On) - automatic level compensation
      Mix (0 - 100%, default 100%) - dry/wet balance

  When to use:
    Distortion, saturation, waveshaping, or lo-fi effects on a stereo bus. Use the table-based modes (Curve, Asymmetrical Curve) for custom transfer functions.

  Common mistakes:
    Autogain masks gain changes. BypassFilters also bypasses DC removal. High oversampling is CPU-expensive.

  Custom equivalent:
    scriptnode HardcodedFX with waveshaper, oversampling, and filtering nodes.

![Shape FX screenshot](/images/v2/reference/audio-modules/shapefx.png)

The Shape FX is a monophonic waveshaper with 14 built-in shaping functions and two user-defined table modes. It processes stereo audio through an optional pre-shaper filter stage, applies gain and DC bias, runs the signal through the selected shaping algorithm (optionally oversampled for reduced aliasing), and mixes the result with the dry signal.

The two table-based modes (Curve and Asymmetrical Curve) allow custom transfer functions drawn in the module's editor. Bit reduction can be layered on top of any shaping mode for lo-fi effects. Autogain keeps the output level consistent as gain and mode settings change.

## Notes

The Drive parameter is vestigial - it is visible in the interface but has no effect on audio processing. Use Gain to control the input level into the shaper.

When using oversampling, the module introduces latency proportional to the oversampling factor. The dry signal path is automatically delayed to stay aligned with the wet signal for correct mix behaviour.

The DC removal filter (30 Hz high-pass) runs after the shaper but is tied to the BypassFilters toggle. If you need bias-driven asymmetric distortion with BypassFilters enabled, be aware that DC offset will remain in the output.

Modes 32 (Curve) and 33 (Asymmetrical Curve) use the lookup table edited in the module's panel. The table maps input amplitude to output amplitude. All other modes use fixed mathematical functions.
