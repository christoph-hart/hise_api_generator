  Transposer (MidiProcessor)

  Shifts incoming MIDI notes up or down by a fixed number of semitones. The offset is applied to note-on events and automatically propagated to their matching note-off events.

  Signal flow:
    MIDI event in -> [if note-on: add TransposeAmount to transpose value] -> MIDI event out

  CPU: negligible (single integer addition per note-on event), monophonic.

  Parameters:
    TransposeAmount (-24 to 24 semitones, default 0) - semitone offset added to each note-on event

  Behaviour:
    - Uses the transpose mechanism rather than modifying note numbers directly, so the original note number is preserved for event matching.
    - Multiple Transposers in a chain stack additively.
    - Parameter changes only affect subsequent note-on events, not currently held notes.
    - No clamping is applied when transposition pushes notes outside the 0-127 range.

  When to use:
    Quick key changes, octave shifts, or interval layering. Place in a sound generator's MIDI chain.

  Common mistakes:
    Expecting held notes to shift when TransposeAmount changes - changes only apply to new notes.
    Transposing near keyboard extremes can push notes outside valid MIDI range.

![Transposer screenshot](/images/v2/reference/audio-modules/transposer.png)

The Transposer shifts incoming MIDI notes up or down by a fixed number of semitones. It operates on note-on events, and the matching note-off events receive the same offset automatically. The original note number is preserved internally - the offset is stored separately, so event matching and other MIDI processors continue to work correctly.

Multiple Transposer modules in the same MIDI chain stack additively: each one adds its offset to whatever transpose value is already on the event. Parameter changes only take effect on subsequent note-on events; notes that are already sounding are not affected.

## Notes

The Transposer uses the transpose mechanism rather than changing note numbers directly. This means the original note number is preserved for event matching, and the effective pitch is calculated by adding the transpose offset at the point of playback. Downstream modules read the combined value when determining pitch.

When transposition pushes a note outside the valid MIDI range (0-127), no clamping or discarding occurs. The out-of-range value is passed through, which may cause unexpected behaviour in downstream modules. With the parameter range limited to -24 to +24 semitones, this only affects notes near the extremes of the keyboard.
