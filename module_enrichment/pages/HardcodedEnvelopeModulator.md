  Hardcoded Envelope Modulator (Modulator/EnvelopeModulator)

  Runs a compiled C++ scriptnode network or custom C++ DSP node as a per-voice envelope modulator at control rate. Produces modulation signal (0-1) per voice. Controls voice lifetime — must signal voice death.

  Signal flow:
    noteOn -> initialise per-voice state -> [compiled network at control rate] -> modulation out (0-1, per voice)
    noteOff -> forwarded for release handling -> signals voice death when finished

  Parameters: Monophonic (index 0), Retrigger (index 1), then network params at index 2+. Custom C++ nodes use createParameters(). See index parent page.
  Complex data: slot counts baked at compile time. See index parent page.
  Custom C++ nodes: see cpp-dsp-nodes language guide.

  CPU: negligible framework overhead, runs at control rate (downsampled), polyphonic.

  Common mistakes:
    Must compile DSP networks before loading.
    Network must signal voice death or voices accumulate.
    Cannot use Monophonic/Retrigger/Intensity as network parameter names.
    Must recompile DLL after HISE updates.

![Hardcoded Envelope Modulator screenshot](/images/v2/reference/audio-modules/hardcodedenvelopemodulator.png)

The Hardcoded Envelope Modulator runs compiled C++ code as a per-voice envelope. It produces a modulation signal between 0 and 1 for each active voice, running at control rate (downsampled) for efficiency. It can load compiled scriptnode networks (visual graphs exported to C++) or custom C++ DSP nodes (hand-written algorithms), both delivered through the same DLL compilation pipeline. Unlike $MODULES.ScriptEnvelopeModulator$ which interprets an XML network or runs HiseScript callbacks, this module loads pre-compiled code for better performance.

The module inherits Monophonic and Retrigger parameters from the envelope base class. When a compiled network or custom node is loaded, its parameters appear after these. The compiled network controls voice lifetime — it must signal when the envelope finishes so that voices can be killed. MIDI note-on and note-off events are forwarded to the network, allowing it to handle attack and release phases. This module produces no audio output — it generates modulation values only.

### What Can Be Loaded

The Hardcoded Envelope Modulator can load two kinds of content, both delivered through the same DLL compilation pipeline:

**Compiled scriptnode networks** are visual graphs designed in the scriptnode editor, then exported to C++. This is the standard workflow: design and iterate visually, then compile for production performance. The compilation step collapses the entire node graph into a single optimised function, eliminating per-node overhead.

**Custom C++ DSP nodes** are hand-written algorithms placed in `DspNetworks/ThirdParty/*.h` files, following the scriptnode node callback interface. This is the path for envelope algorithms with no stock equivalent — custom multi-stage shapes, retriggerable patterns, or unconventional modulation curves. See [Custom C++ Nodes](#custom-c-nodes) below.

Both types use the same internal dispatch mechanism and appear in the same module dropdown.

### Compiled vs Interpreted

The Hardcoded Envelope Modulator and $MODULES.ScriptEnvelopeModulator$ both host custom envelope logic. ScriptEnvelopeModulator can run either an XML scriptnode network or HiseScript callbacks. The Hardcoded version loads compiled C++ code, eliminating interpretation overhead. Since envelopes run per voice, the performance benefit multiplies with the voice count.

### Loading a Compiled Network

Compile your scriptnode networks or custom C++ nodes using **Export > Compile DSP Networks as DLL**. Then select the network from the module's dropdown — network parameters and complex data objects appear automatically based on what the compiled code declares. The network must output a single channel of modulation values. On note-on, the network's per-voice state is initialised and one sample is processed immediately to provide the initial envelope value.

Custom C++ nodes from the `DspNetworks/ThirdParty/` folder appear in the same dropdown alongside compiled scriptnode networks. Both load identically from the module's perspective.

During development, the DLL hot-loads when recompiled — restart HISE or recompile to pick up changes. In exported plugins, compiled networks and custom nodes are built directly into the binary (no DLL needed).

### Parameter Exposure and Complex Data

The first two parameters (Monophonic at index 0, Retrigger at index 1) are fixed and inherited from the envelope base class. Network parameters appear after these with indices starting from 2. Network parameter names must not collide with Monophonic, Retrigger, or Intensity. For custom C++ nodes, parameters are registered via the `createParameters()` callback. Complex data slot counts are baked into the compiled code at compile time. See [Custom module hosting](/v2/reference/audio-modules/#custom) for the full parameter and complex data reference.

### Voice Lifetime

The compiled network controls when voices are killed. It must use the voice reset mechanism to signal that the envelope has finished (typically when the release phase reaches zero). If the network never signals voice death, voices will accumulate and CPU usage will increase indefinitely. This is the primary role of an envelope modulator — it acts as the voice killer for its parent sound generator.

### Custom C++ Nodes

This module can load custom C++ DSP nodes from `DspNetworks/ThirdParty/*.h` in addition to compiled scriptnode networks. See the [C++ DSP Nodes]($LANG.cpp-dsp-nodes$) guide for the complete callback interface, workflow, and worked examples.

### Export Workflow

There are two workflows depending on what you are loading:

**Compiled scriptnode network**: Design your envelope network in the scriptnode editor. When ready for production, use **Export > Compile DSP Networks as DLL** to compile it. Add a Hardcoded Envelope Modulator to your sound generator's Gain Modulation chain, and select the network from the dropdown. On plugin export, the network is baked directly into the binary.

**Custom C++ node**: Write your `.h` file in `DspNetworks/ThirdParty/`. Compile the DLL — the node auto-loads in HISE and appears in the module dropdown. On plugin export, the C++ code is compiled directly into the binary alongside the rest of the plugin.

In both cases, the exported plugin contains no DLL and no XML — everything runs as native compiled code.
