  Sine Wave Generator (SoundGenerator)

  Lightweight polyphonic sine wave oscillator with two tuning modes and optional saturation waveshaping. Designed for sub-bass layers, FM carrier/modulator tones, and adding subtle harmonics.

  Signal flow:
    MIDI note -> pitch calculation (tuning factor) -> phase accumulator -> sine table lookup -> saturation -> gain modulation -> mono-to-stereo -> effect chain -> audio out

  CPU: very low per voice, polyphonic

  Parameters:
    OctaveTranspose (-5 to 5 octaves, default 0) - coarse pitch offset in musical mode
    SemiTones (-12 to 12 semitones, default 0) - fine pitch offset in musical mode
    UseFreqRatio (Off/On, default Off) - switches to harmonic ratio tuning mode
    CoarseFreqRatio (-5 to 16, default 1) - harmonic multiplier in ratio mode
    FineFreqRatio (0-1, default 0) - fractional frequency offset in ratio mode
    SaturationAmount (0-100%, default 0%) - soft-clipping waveshaping to add harmonics
    Gain (0-100%, default 25%) - output volume as linear gain, modulatable via Gain Modulation chain
    Balance (-1 to 1, default 0) - stereo balance
    VoiceLimit (1-256, default 256) - maximum polyphony
    KillFadeTime (0-20000 ms, default 20 ms) - fade-out when voices are killed

  Modulation chains:
    Gain Modulation - scales the output volume (linked to Gain parameter)
    Pitch Modulation - scales the pitch of all voices (standalone, per-sample)

  When to use:
    Sub-bass oscillator, FM synthesis carrier or modulator, test tone, layering a sine undertone beneath samples. Not recommended for additive synthesis with many partials due to per-instance overhead.

  Common mistakes:
    Multiple SineSynth instances for additive synthesis - use scriptnode instead.
    SaturationAmount = 1.0 produces silence (clamped to 0.99 internally).
    OctaveTranspose/SemiTones ignored when UseFreqRatio is On (mutually exclusive).

  Custom equivalent:
    scriptnode SoundGenerator with sine oscillator node.

![Sine Wave Generator screenshot](/images/v2/reference/audio-modules/sinesynth.png)

The Sine Wave Generator produces a pure sine tone from a 2048-sample lookup table with linear interpolation. It is the lightest sound generator in HISE, designed for sub-bass layers, FM synthesis building blocks, and adding subtle harmonics beneath sampled or synthesised sounds.

Two tuning modes are available. Musical mode offsets the pitch by octaves and semitones. Ratio mode sets the frequency as a harmonic multiplier of the root note, useful for FM synthesis where carrier-to-modulator ratios define the timbre. A saturation waveshaper can add harmonics to the pure sine, progressively driving it towards a soft-clipped shape.

### Tuning Modes

The two tuning modes are mutually exclusive. When UseFreqRatio is Off, OctaveTranspose and SemiTones set the pitch offset using the formula `2^(octaves + semitones/12)`. When UseFreqRatio is On, CoarseFreqRatio and FineFreqRatio define a harmonic multiplier. Changing the inactive mode's parameters has no effect until that mode is selected.

### Ratio Mode Harmonics

In ratio mode, the coarse ratio maps directly to harmonic numbers: 1 = fundamental, 2 = second harmonic (octave), 3 = third harmonic (octave + fifth), and so on. For sub-harmonics, negative coarse values use exponential division. The fine ratio is always added as a linear offset for detuning.

### Saturation Character

The saturation waveshaper uses a soft-clipping transfer function that progressively adds odd harmonics to the sine wave. At low values it produces a subtle warmth; at high values the waveform approaches a clipped shape with audible overtones. This is useful for thickening a sine bass without needing a separate effect.

### Output Routing

The sine output is generated in mono and copied to both channels. The Balance parameter is applied by the base class after the voice buffer is complete. An effect chain slot is available for per-voice effects.
