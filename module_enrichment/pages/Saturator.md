  Saturator (MasterEffect)

  Simple soft-clip waveshaper with pre/post gain staging and dry/wet mix. Uses the formula (1+k)*x / (1+k*|x|) where k = 2*saturation/(1-saturation). No oversampling. Saturation Modulation chain scales the saturation amount.

  Signal flow:
    audio in -> PreGain (0-24 dB boost) -> soft-clip waveshaper -> PostGain (-24 to 0 dB cut) -> dry/wet mix -> audio out

  CPU: low, monophonic (MasterEffect).

  Parameters:
    Saturation (0-100%, default 0%) - waveshaping intensity. 0 = linear, approaching 100% = hard clip.
    WetAmount (0-100%, default 100%) - linear dry/wet crossfade
    PreGain (0-24 dB, default 0 dB) - boost-only input gain before saturation
    PostGain (-24 to 0 dB, default 0 dB) - cut-only output gain after saturation

  Modulation chains:
    Saturation Modulation - scales the saturation amount. Updated every 8 samples when audio-rate modulation is active.

  When to use:
    Adding warmth, harmonics, or soft clipping to a signal. Use PreGain to drive into the nonlinear range and PostGain to compensate.

  Common mistakes:
    Signal must be driven with PreGain to hear saturation on quiet signals.
    At Saturation=0 the waveshaper is linear but gain staging still applies.

  Custom equivalent:
    scriptnode HardcodedFX: gain + waveshaper + mix nodes.

![Saturator screenshot](/images/v2/reference/audio-modules/saturator.png)

A simple soft-clip waveshaper that adds harmonic saturation to the signal. The effect uses a smooth transfer function that progressively limits signal amplitude as the Saturation parameter increases, introducing odd harmonics without hard clipping. Pre and post gain controls allow driving the signal into the nonlinear range and compensating the output level.

The Saturation Modulation chain allows dynamic control of the saturation intensity from envelopes, LFOs, or other modulators. At Saturation=0 the waveshaper is fully linear, making the module behave as a pure gain stage with just PreGain and PostGain.

groups:
  - label: Saturation
    params:
      - { name: Saturation, desc: "Controls the intensity of the waveshaping. At 0% the signal passes through linearly.

      - { name: PreGain, desc: "Boost-only input gain applied before the waveshaper. Use this to drive the signal into the nonlinear range. At 0 dB the signal is unchanged.", range: "0 - 24 dB", default: "0 dB" }
      - { name: PostGain, desc: "Cut-only output gain applied after the waveshaper. Use this to compensate for the level increase caused by PreGain and saturation. At 0 dB the signal is unchanged.", range: "-24 - 0 dB", default: "0 dB" }

## Modulation Chains

chains:
  - { name: "Saturation Modulation", desc: "Scales the Saturation parameter value. The modulation output multiplies the parameter value rather than replacing it. When audio-rate modulators are used, the saturation amount is updated every 8 samples.", scope: "monophonic", constrainer: "TimeVariantModulator" }

## Notes

The waveshaper does not use oversampling. At high saturation levels with high-frequency content, aliasing may be audible. For critical applications, consider using the ShapeFX module which offers oversampling options.

The PreGain range is 0-24 dB (boost only) and PostGain is -24 to 0 dB (cut only). This enforces a workflow where you drive the signal in and compensate on the way out.
