    explanation: "The delay in SimpleGain is designed for timing alignment (e.g. compensating for latency), not for creating audible echo effects. It has no feedback path."

    wrong: "Setting Width to 0 expecting silence"
    right: "Width=0 produces a mono signal (mid only), not silence. Width=100 is unchanged stereo."
    explanation: "The Width parameter works on the mid/side balance. At 0% only the mid (mono) signal remains. At 200% the side signal is exaggerated."

  Simple Gain (MasterEffect)

  Utility gain processor with optional delay, stereo width (mid/side), balance (pan), and polarity inversion. Four independent modulation chains control Gain, Delay, Width, and Balance. Processing order: polarity inversion -> delay -> gain -> width -> balance.

  Signal flow:
    audio in -> invert polarity (if on) -> delay (if > 0ms) -> smoothed gain -> mid/side width (if != 100%) -> balance pan -> audio out

  CPU: low, monophonic (MasterEffect). Delay and width add moderate cost when active.

  Parameters:
    Gain (-100 to 36 dB, default 0 dB) - output gain with 50ms smoothing
    Delay (0-500 ms, default 0 ms) - static delay with crossfade on time change
    Width (0-200%, default 100%) - stereo width via mid/side. 0=mono, 100=unchanged, 200=exaggerated sides.
    Balance (pan, default centre) - stereo pan position with 1000ms smoothing
    InvertPolarity (Off/On, default Off) - flips signal phase

  Modulation chains:
    Gain Modulation - scales gain per-block
    Delay Modulation - scales delay time per-block
    Width Modulation - interpolates between 1.0 and width value per-block
    Pan Modulation - scales balance value per-block

  When to use:
    Level automation, timing alignment, stereo width adjustment, panning, phase correction. The most common utility effect in HISE signal chains.

  Common mistakes:
    Delay is static with no feedback - use the Delay module for echoes.
    Width=0 is mono, not silence.

![Simple Gain screenshot](/images/v2/reference/audio-modules/simplegain.png)

A utility effect that combines gain control, static delay, stereo width adjustment, stereo balance (panning), and polarity inversion into a single module. Despite its name, it offers more than simple gain - it is the standard utility module for level automation, timing alignment, and stereo image control.

Each of the four main parameters (Gain, Delay, Width, Balance) has its own modulation chain. The processing order is fixed: polarity inversion is applied first, followed by delay, gain, width, and finally balance. Features that are at their default values (delay=0, width=100%, balance=centre) are skipped entirely, keeping CPU usage minimal.

### Smoothing

The gain smoothing ramp is 50 ms, while the balance smoothing is 1000 ms. Sound generators' own Gain parameter has no smoothing, so use SimpleGain for click-free automated gain changes on samplers and other sound generators. [1]($FORUM_REF.8822$)

### Width Behaviour

When Width is exactly 100% (the default), mid/side processing is skipped entirely. Width has no effect on a mono source (where L equals R) because mid/side encoding produces zero side signal. To widen a mono source, create stereo differences first using a short delay (Haas effect) or chorus, then apply Width. [2]($FORUM_REF.7956$) Width above 100% amplifies the side signal only, which can introduce out-of-phase content that cancels when summed to mono.

### Multi-Channel Routing

When a Sampler uses multiple mic channels, placing a single SimpleGain in the Sampler's FX chain provides boost but gain reduction below 0 dB has no audible effect due to signal doubling from the multi-channel routing. Use one SimpleGain per mic channel, or place the Sampler inside a Container and attach SimpleGain there. [3]($FORUM_REF.1252$)

### Pan Modulation Range

Pan Modulation scales the existing Balance offset, so with Balance at centre (0), the modulation has zero range and no audible effect. Set Balance to a non-centre value (e.g. full right) to give the Pan Modulation chain a range to work within. [4]($FORUM_REF.6062$)
