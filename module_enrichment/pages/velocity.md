  Velocity Modulator (Modulator/VoiceStartModulator)

  Converts MIDI note-on velocity into a per-voice modulation value (0-1). Three optional processing stages - inversion, table lookup, and decibel conversion - shape the velocity response curve.

  Signal flow:
    noteOn velocity -> [invert] -> [table lookup] -> [dB conversion] -> modulation out

  CPU: negligible, polyphonic (runs once per voice on note-on)

  Parameters:
    Inverted (Off/On, default Off) - flips the velocity curve so loud notes produce low modulation values
    UseTable (Off/On, default Off) - enables a user-editable curve for custom velocity response
    DecibelMode (Off/On, default Off) - maps the value through a -100..0 dB range then converts to linear gain, providing a more perceptually natural response

  When to use:
    Standard velocity-to-volume or velocity-to-filter mapping. Use the table for custom response curves. Enable DecibelMode when mapping to gain parameters for a more natural dynamic feel.

  Common mistakes:
    DecibelMode applies after the table, not before - the table always works in linear domain.
    UseTable must be enabled for the curve editor to have any effect.

  Custom equivalent:
    hisescript via ScriptVoiceStartModulator: read Message.getVelocity() and apply transforms in onVoiceStart.

  See also:
    alternative KeyNumber - reads note number instead of velocity
    alternative ArrayModulator - per-note values from a slider pack
    disambiguation Constant - fixed modulation value, no MIDI input

![Velocity Modulator screenshot](/images/v2/reference/audio-modules/velocity.png)

The Velocity Modulator reads the MIDI velocity of each incoming note and converts it to a per-voice modulation value between 0 and 1. It is one of the most commonly used modulators, typically driving gain or filter cutoff to create velocity-sensitive dynamics.

Three optional stages transform the raw velocity value. **Inverted** flips the response so that soft notes produce high values. **UseTable** enables a curve editor for drawing custom velocity response shapes. **DecibelMode** applies a logarithmic gain curve that maps the value through a -100 to 0 dB range, providing a more perceptually natural dynamic response than the default linear mapping. These stages are applied in fixed order and can be combined freely.

## Notes

The three processing stages are applied in fixed order: inversion first, table lookup second, decibel conversion last. The table always operates in the linear 0-1 domain regardless of whether DecibelMode is enabled - the dB conversion happens after the table output.

When both Inverted and UseTable are active, the table receives the inverted value. Design your table curve with this in mind - the X axis represents the already-inverted velocity.
