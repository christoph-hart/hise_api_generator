  StereoFX (VoiceEffect, polyphonic)

  Polyphonic stereo panner with mid/side width control. Pan is modulation-driven and applied per-voice; Width is applied once to the combined output.

  Signal flow:
    per-voice: audio in -> pan modulation (equal-power, audio-rate capable) -> panned voice output
    shared: combined voices -> mid/side width processing -> audio out

  CPU: low, polyphonic (scales with voice count for pan; width runs once on combined output).

  Parameters:
    Pan (-100 to 100, default 100) - maximum pan modulation range. Not a static position. Requires modulators in the Pan Modulation chain.
    Width (0 to 200%, default 100%) - stereo width via mid/side encoding. 0=mono, 100=passthrough, 200=exaggerated stereo.

  Modulation chains:
    Pan Modulation - drives the per-voice pan position. Audio-rate capable. Accepts any modulator type.

  When to use:
    Per-voice stereo placement driven by modulators (LFOs, envelopes, random). Not a static pan knob - use SimpleGain for static balance.

  Common mistakes:
    Pan parameter does nothing without modulators in the Pan Modulation chain.
    Width has no effect on mono signals (identical L/R).

  Custom equivalent:
    scriptnode HardcodedFX: pan + mid/side width nodes.

![Stereo FX screenshot](/images/v2/reference/audio-modules/stereofx.png)

A polyphonic stereo processor with two stages: per-voice panning and shared stereo width. The Pan parameter defines the maximum modulation range for the Pan Modulation chain rather than setting a static pan position - without modulators in the chain, no panning occurs. Each voice is panned independently using an equal-power pan law, allowing per-voice stereo placement driven by LFOs, envelopes, or random modulators. The pan modulation supports audio-rate updates for smooth, zipper-free sweeps.

The Width parameter applies mid/side processing to the combined output after all voices are summed. At 0% the output collapses to mono, at 100% (default) the signal passes through unchanged, and values above 100% exaggerate the stereo difference. Because Width operates on the summed buffer, it affects all voices equally.

## Notes

The Pan parameter is a modulation range scaler, not a static pan control. This is by design - StereoFX is intended for modulation-driven per-voice panning. For static stereo balance, use SimpleGain instead.

Width is applied to the combined output buffer after all voices are summed, not per-voice. All voices share the same stereo width setting.

Pan uses an equal-power pan law that maintains unity gain at centre. At full left or right, the active channel is boosted by approximately 3 dB to preserve perceived loudness.
