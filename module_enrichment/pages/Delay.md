commonMistakes:
  - title: "Filter parameters have no effect"
    wrong: "Adjusting the Low-Pass or High-Pass filter parameters expecting them to shape the delay feedback tone"
    right: "These parameters have no effect on the audio output"
    explanation: "The LowPassFreq and HiPassFreq parameters are defined in the interface but are not connected to any filtering. They appear in the metadata but do not affect processing."
  - title: "1.0 feedback causes infinite accumulation"
    wrong: "Setting FeedbackLeft or FeedbackRight to 1.0 expecting infinite sustain"
    right: "A feedback of 1.0 produces infinite repeats that never decay. The signal will accumulate and eventually clip."
    explanation: "Unlike some delay plugins that limit feedback below unity, this delay allows true 1.0 feedback. Use values below 0.95 for repeats that decay naturally."

  Delay (MasterEffect)

  Stereo delay with independent left/right times, feedback, and optional tempo sync. Uses an overlap fader for dry/wet mixing. The LowPassFreq and HiPassFreq parameters are defined but vestigial - they have no effect on audio.

  Signal flow:
    audio in -> per-sample: dryMix * sample + wetMix * delayLine(sample + lastOutput * feedback) -> audio out

  CPU: medium, monophonic (MasterEffect).

  Parameters:
    DelayTimeLeft (0-3000 ms or tempo-synced, default QuarterTriplet synced) - left channel delay time. 1ms granularity; max depends on sample rate (~2730ms at 48kHz, ~1365ms at 96kHz).
    DelayTimeRight (0-3000 ms or tempo-synced, default Quarter synced) - right channel delay time. Same limitations as left.
    FeedbackLeft (0-100%, default 30%) - left channel feedback
    FeedbackRight (0-100%, default 30%) - right channel feedback
    LowPassFreq (20-20000 Hz, default 20000 Hz) - has no effect (vestigial)
    HiPassFreq (20-20000 Hz, default 40 Hz) - has no effect (vestigial)
    Mix (0-100%, default 50%) - overlap fader dry/wet blend
    TempoSync (Off/On, default On) - sync delay times to host tempo

  When to use:
    Rhythmic echo effects, ping-pong style delays (using different L/R times), slapback delays.

  Common mistakes:
    LowPassFreq and HiPassFreq have no effect.
    Feedback of 1.0 produces infinite non-decaying repeats.

  Custom equivalent:
    scriptnode HardcodedFX: delay line nodes with feedback and tempo sync.

![Delay screenshot](/images/v2/reference/audio-modules/delay.png)

A zero-latency stereo delay effect with independent left and right delay times, feedback controls, and optional tempo synchronisation. Each channel has its own delay line with adjustable feedback for controlling the number of repeats. The dry/wet mix uses an overlap fader that keeps the combined level more consistent than a linear crossfade. The first audio buffer after initialisation is skipped to avoid outputting uninitialised delay buffer contents.

When tempo sync is enabled (the default), the delay times snap to musical note values from whole notes down to 1/64th triplets. The delay crossfades between old and new read positions when the time changes, preventing clicks during automation or tempo changes.

### Timing Limitations

Delay times are rounded to whole milliseconds (1ms granularity). For sub-millisecond or sample-accurate delays, use a scriptnode delay node instead. [1]($FORUM_REF.11516$)

The internal delay buffer has a fixed size of 131072 samples, which limits the achievable maximum delay time depending on the host sample rate. At 48kHz, the maximum is approximately 2730ms rather than the 3000ms shown in the parameter range. At 96kHz, the maximum drops to approximately 1365ms.
