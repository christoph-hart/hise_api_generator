  Flex AHDSR Envelope (Modulator/EnvelopeModulator)

  A per-voice AHDSR envelope with independent power-curve shaping per stage (Attack, Hold, Decay, Sustain, Release) and three playback modes. Uses progress-based power curves rather than coefficient-based exponentials, giving direct control over each stage's curvature.

  Signal flow:
    noteOn -> evaluate mod chains -> Attack (curved) -> Hold (flat) -> Decay (curved) -> Sustain (flat) -> noteOff -> Release (curved) -> done
    Mode controls sustain behaviour: Note=hold at sustain, Trigger=skip sustain (one-shot), Loop=repeat attack-through-release while gate active.

  CPU: low, polyphonic. Processed at control rate (downsampled from audio rate). Linear curves use a fast path avoiding pow().

  Parameters:
    Attack (0-30000 ms, default 5 ms) - time to reach AttackLevel
    Hold (0-30000 ms, default 0 ms) - time held at AttackLevel before decay
    Decay (0-30000 ms, default 100 ms) - time to fall from AttackLevel to Sustain
    Sustain (0.0-1.0, default 0.5) - level held during note (linear amplitude, not dB)
    Release (0-30000 ms, default 300 ms) - time to fall to zero after note-off
    Mode (Trigger, Note, Loop, default Note) - playback behaviour
    AttackLevel (0.0-1.0, default 1.0) - peak level at end of attack (linear amplitude)
    AttackCurve (0.0-1.0, default 0.5) - attack curvature (0.5=linear)
    DecayCurve (0.0-1.0, default 0.5) - decay curvature (0.5=linear)
    ReleaseCurve (0.0-1.0, default 0.5) - release curvature (0.5=linear)
    Monophonic (Off/On, default dynamic) - forces single voice
    Retrigger (Off/On, default On) - restarts envelope on new note in monophonic mode

  Modulation chains (5):
    AttackTimeModulation (VoiceStart) - multiplies attack time
    AttackLevelModulation (VoiceStart) - multiplies attack and hold level
    DecayTimeModulation (VoiceStart) - multiplies decay time
    SustainLevelModulation (VoiceStart + TimeVariant) - multiplies sustain and decay target level
    ReleaseTimeModulation (VoiceStart) - multiplies release time

  Common mistakes:
    Trigger mode skips sustain entirely - use Note mode for standard AHDSR.
    Curve values: 0.5=linear, not 0=linear.
    Envelope state requires Engine.addModuleStateToUserPreset() for preset recall.

  Custom equivalent:
    scriptnode via HardcodedEnvelopeModulator using the envelope.flex_ahdsr node.

![Flex AHDSR Envelope screenshot](/images/v2/reference/audio-modules/flexahdsr.png)

The Flex AHDSR Envelope is a per-voice envelope modulator with independent power-curve shaping for each timed stage. Unlike the standard [AHDSR]($MODULES.AHDSR$) which uses coefficient-based exponential curves with a single shared decay/release shape, the FlexAHDSR gives separate curve control over Attack, Decay, and Release and uses a progress-based power-curve approach that maps directly to visual drag handles in the envelope display.

Three playback modes control how the envelope responds to note events. **Note** mode is the standard AHDSR behaviour where the sustain stage holds until note-off. **Trigger** mode plays through all stages as a one-shot, skipping sustain entirely - useful for percussive sounds or sound effects. **Loop** mode repeats the envelope from attack through release for as long as the note is held, creating rhythmic or tremolo-like effects. The Sustain and AttackLevel parameters are linear amplitude values (0-1), not decibel values.

### Playback Modes

The three modes differ only in how the sustain and done states are handled:

- **Note:** The envelope holds at the sustain level until note-off triggers the release stage. This is standard AHDSR behaviour.
- **Trigger:** The envelope plays through attack, hold, decay, and release as a continuous one-shot. The sustain stage is skipped entirely. Note-off is ignored for stage progression (though it can still trigger release if it arrives during an earlier stage).
- **Loop:** Like Trigger, the sustain stage is skipped. When the release stage completes, the envelope restarts from the attack stage as long as the note is still held. On note-off, the current cycle completes and the voice ends.

### Sustain Modulation

The SustainLevelModulation chain is the only chain that accepts time-variant modulators (e.g. LFOs). All other chains are constrained to voice-start modulators. When a time-variant modulator is present on the sustain chain, the envelope switches to per-sample processing for that chain, which adds a small amount of CPU overhead.

### Visualisation with FlexAHDSRGraph

The envelope shape can be displayed and edited interactively using the FlexAHDSRGraph FloatingTile. This component draws the envelope path from parameter values and shows a playback ball tracking the last triggered voice. The FloatingTile has a `UseOneDimensionDrag` property (default: true) that constrains drag gestures to one axis at a time. Set it to false to allow simultaneous time and level adjustment in a single drag.

> [!Tip:Use a dedicated MIDI processor for realtime parameter control] When scripting velocity-to-parameter mappings for the FlexAHDSR, place the logic in a separate MIDI processor script rather than the Interface script. The Interface script runs deferred, so realtime parameter changes from note events require a non-deferred processor.

> [!Warning:Call addModuleStateToUserPreset for preset recall] The FlexAHDSR envelope state is not included in user presets by default. Call `Engine.addModuleStateToUserPreset("envelopeId")` to ensure the envelope configuration is saved and restored with presets.

### Look and Feel Callbacks

The FlexAHDSRGraph supports seven LAF callbacks for full visual customisation:

- `drawFlexAhdsrBackground` - background fill
- `drawFlexAhdsrFullPath` - complete envelope path
- `drawFlexAhdsrSegment` - individual stage segment (the `obj.active` property reflects whether the segment is currently being played, not hovered)
- `drawFlexAhdsrCurvePoint` - curve drag handle
- `drawFlexAhdsrDragPoint` - stage time/level drag handle
- `drawFlexAhdsrPosition` - playback ball position
- `drawFlexAhdsrText` - parameter label text
