  Global Modulator Container (SoundGenerator)

  A silent Sound Generator that hosts modulators and makes their computed values available to consumer modules elsewhere in the module tree. Produces no audio output.

  Signal flow:
    MIDI input -> phantom voice allocation -> hosted modulators compute -> values stored in shared buffers -> consumers read from buffers

  Three data types shared:
    VoiceStart: 128-element per-note arrays (indexed by MIDI note number)
    TimeVariant: per-block shared buffers (monophonic)
    Envelope: per-voice event-indexed buffers (polyphonic, synced via event IDs)

  CPU: very low baseline. The container itself does no DSP. Hosted modulators compute as they would if placed locally. Sharing saves CPU when the same modulation drives multiple targets.

  Parameters:
    Gain (0-100%, default 25%) - vestigial, no audio effect
    Balance (-100L to 100R, default centre) - vestigial, no audio effect
    VoiceLimit (1-256, default 256) - limits phantom voices for polyphonic modulators
    KillFadeTime (0-20000 ms, default 20 ms) - fade time when phantom voices are killed

  Modulation chains:
    Global Modulators - hosts any modulator type except Global*Modulator consumers (prevents circular references)
    Pitch Modulation - disabled

  When to use:
    When the same modulation source (LFO, envelope, velocity, etc.) needs to drive parameters across multiple Sound Generators. Place the source modulator here once, then add lightweight consumer modules wherever needed.

  Placement: must be above all consumers in the module tree. Place as the first Sound Generator in the top-level container.

  Chain limit: 64 modulators per chain (HISE_NUM_MODULATORS_PER_CHAIN). Configurable via Extra Definitions.

  LFO retriggering: hosted LFOs retrigger on every note-on. For free-running, use Message.ignoreEvent(true) in a Script Processor before the container.

  Common mistakes:
    Expecting audio output - it produces silence.
    Adding consumers inside the container's own chain - they are blocked by the constrainer.
    Using Message.setNoteNumber() before the container - breaks voice-start modulator lookup by note index. Use Message.setTransposeAmount() instead.

![Global Modulator Container screenshot](/images/v2/reference/audio-modules/globalmodulatorcontainer.png)

The Global Modulator Container is a silent Sound Generator that hosts modulators for sharing across the module tree. Add any standard modulator (LFO, envelope, velocity, random, etc.) to its Global Modulators chain, then place lightweight consumer modules in other Sound Generators' modulation chains to read from the shared source.

This is the producer half of HISE's global modulation system. It allocates phantom voices internally so that polyphonic modulators (envelopes, voice-start modulators) have the per-voice context they need, but it produces no audio output. The Pitch Modulation chain is disabled and cannot be used. The real CPU savings come from computing a modulation source once here instead of duplicating it across multiple targets.

### Placement

The container must be placed above all consumer modules in the module tree. Consumer modules search upward through the tree for containers, so a container placed below or beside a consumer will not be found and the connection silently fails. Place the Global Modulator Container as the first Sound Generator in the top-level container. [1]($FORUM_REF.1015$)

### Polyphonic Behaviour

Polyphonic envelope synchronisation between the container and consumers uses event IDs rather than voice indices. Consumers work correctly even when the consumer's parent Sound Generator has a different voice allocation than the container. A two-phase release mechanism prevents envelope tails from being cut off prematurely when voices are reused.

Voice-start modulators store their computed values indexed by MIDI note number. If a Script Processor remaps note numbers using `Message.setNoteNumber()` before the container processes the event, the consumer module looks up the wrong index and the modulation value is silently lost. Use `Message.setTransposeAmount()` instead - it shifts pitch without altering the note number used for the lookup. [2]($FORUM_REF.6390$)

### LFO Retriggering

Hosted LFOs retrigger their phase on every incoming note-on event. To achieve a free-running global LFO unaffected by new notes, place a Script Processor before the container that calls `Message.ignoreEvent(true)` in its `onNoteOn` callback. [3]($FORUM_REF.6813$)
