  Macro Modulation Source (SoundGenerator)

  A container that hosts modulation chains whose output drives the global macro control system. Does not generate audio - uses the SoundGenerator infrastructure to participate in the rendering pipeline and host modulation chains.

  Signal flow:
    Macro chains (1-8) -> render chains -> read first sample per block -> delta check -> scale to 0-127 -> macro control system

  CPU: very low base, depends on modulator complexity in macro chains. Monophonic.

  Parameters (inherited, vestigial):
    Gain (0-100%, default 25%) - NOT applied in processing
    Balance (-1 to 1, default 0) - NOT applied in processing
    VoiceLimit (1-256, default 256) - irrelevant (no audio voices)
    KillFadeTime (0-20000 ms, default 20 ms) - irrelevant (no audio voices)

  Modulation chains (active):
    Macro 1-8 - each chain's output drives the corresponding macro control slot. Updated per-block. Any modulator type accepted.

  Modulation chains (disabled):
    Gain Modulation - not applicable (no audio)
    Pitch Modulation - not applicable (no oscillator)

  When to use:
    Driving macro controls from modulation sources (LFOs, envelopes, constant modulators). Place modulators in the Macro 1-8 chains to automate macro knob values from within the module tree.

  Common mistakes:
    This module produces no audio despite being a SoundGenerator.
    Gain/Balance knobs have no effect - use the macro chains directly.

  Custom equivalent:
    scriptnode SoundGenerator with global cables to macro slots.

![Macro Modulation Source screenshot](/images/v2/reference/audio-modules/macromodulationsource.png)

The Macro Modulation Source hosts modulation chains that drive the global macro control slots. Each of its Macro chains (1 through 8 by default) feeds its output value into the corresponding macro control slot, allowing LFOs, envelopes, and other modulators to automate macro knobs from within the module tree.

This module does not generate audio. It is classified as a SoundGenerator to participate in the rendering pipeline and host its modulation chains, but its voices produce no output. The only user-facing features are the Macro modulation chain slots.

## Notes

The number of macro chains defaults to 8 but is configurable per-project via the HISE_NUM_MACROS setting (up to a maximum of 64). The module automatically creates the correct number of chains to match the project configuration.

Each macro chain's output is sampled once per audio block (at the first sample position). This means the update rate for macro values is the block rate, not per-sample. For most use cases this provides sufficiently smooth control. If you need per-sample resolution on the receiving end, use a Macro Modulator with smoothing enabled.

Only changed values trigger macro system updates. If a chain's output is the same as the previous block, no update is sent. This prevents unnecessary processing in the macro distribution system.

Empty chains are skipped entirely - they do not send a zero value or reset the macro slot. A macro chain with no modulators simply has no effect on its corresponding slot.
