  AHDSR Envelope (Modulator/EnvelopeModulator)

  Five-stage envelope modulator: Attack, Hold, Decay, Sustain, Release. Runs as a per-voice state machine at control rate. Produces a 0-1 modulation signal that multiplies into the voice audio buffer.

  Signal flow:
    noteOn -> capture mod chains -> compute per-voice coefficients -> ATTACK -> HOLD -> DECAY -> SUSTAIN
    noteOff -> RELEASE -> IDLE (voice killed)

  CPU: low, polyphonic. Slightly heavier than SimpleEnvelope due to additional stages and curve shaping.

  Parameters:
    Attack (0 - 20000 ms, default 20 ms) - time to reach peak level
    AttackLevel (-100 - 0 dB, default 0 dB) - peak level at end of attack
    Hold (0 - 20000 ms, default 10 ms) - time held at peak before decay
    Decay (1 - 20000 ms, default 300 ms) - time to fall from peak to sustain
    Sustain (-100 - 0 dB, default 0 dB) - level held while note is down
    Release (1 - 20000 ms, default 20 ms) - time to fall to zero after note-off
    AttackCurve (0.0 - 1.0, default 0.0) - attack shape: 0.0=concave, 0.5=linear, 1.0=convex
    DecayCurve (0.0 - 1.0, default 0.0) - decay and release shape: 0.0=steep, 1.0=gentle
    Monophonic (Off/On, default dynamic) - shared envelope for all voices
    Retrigger (Off/On, default On) - restart envelope on new note in monophonic mode
    EcoMode (Off/On, default On) - vestigial, no effect

  Modulation chains (all per-voice, VoiceStartModulator, gain mode):
    AttackTimeModulation - multiplies attack time in ms
    AttackLevelModulation - multiplies attack level as linear gain
    DecayTimeModulation - multiplies decay time in ms
    SustainLevelModulation - multiplies sustain level as linear gain
    ReleaseTimeModulation - multiplies release time in ms

  Key behaviours:
    - If AttackLevel is below Sustain, Hold and Decay are skipped entirely.
    - DecayCurve controls both decay and release shape (no separate release curve).
    - Monophonic mode disables voice killing; add a second polyphonic envelope as a workaround.
    - Mod chains are evaluated once at note-on and multiply the parameter value.
    - EcoMode is vestigial; downsampling is controlled globally.

  Common mistakes:
    DecayCurve shapes both decay and release identically.
    Level modulation multiplies linear gain, not dB offset.
    Monophonic mode prevents voice killing.

  Custom equivalent:
    scriptnode via HardcodedEnvelopeModulator (medium complexity), or HISEScript via ScriptEnvelopeModulator.

    alternative SimpleEnvelope - lighter, attack+release only
    alternative TableEnvelope - table-driven shapes

![AHDSR Envelope screenshot](/images/v2/reference/audio-modules/ahdsr.png)

The AHDSR is a five-stage envelope modulator that shapes the amplitude of each voice over time. It progresses through Attack, Hold, Decay, Sustain, and Release stages, producing a modulation signal between 0 and 1 that multiplies into the voice audio buffer. Every sound generator in HISE needs at least one envelope to control when voices start and stop - the AHDSR is the standard choice for this role. The exclamation mark icon on an envelope in the module tree indicates that it acts as the voice killer for its parent sound generator.

Each time parameter (Attack, Decay, Release) has a dedicated modulation chain that can vary the timing per voice at note-on. The two level parameters (AttackLevel, Sustain) also have modulation chains that scale the level per voice. The `AttackCurve` parameter shapes the attack from concave (logarithmic) through linear to convex (exponential), while `DecayCurve` shapes both the decay and release phases from steep to gentle. For independent curve control over each stage, use [FlexAHDSR]($MODULES.FlexAHDSR$) instead. For instruments that do not need Hold, Decay, or curve shaping, [SimpleEnvelope]($MODULES.SimpleEnvelope$) is a lighter alternative.

### Monophonic Behaviour

In monophonic mode, all voices share a single envelope. The first note always starts a fresh envelope from zero. Subsequent notes either restart from the current value (Retrigger on) or continue from the current state (Retrigger off).

### Visualisation with AHDSRGraph

The `AHDSRGraph` FloatingTile displays the envelope shape with an animated ball showing the current position. Customise the appearance using Global Look and Feel callbacks: `drawAhdsrBackground`, `drawAhdsrPath`, and `drawAhdsrBall`. These require a Global LAF - local LAF does not work for these callbacks.

**See also:** $MODULES.FlexAHDSR$ -- more flexible envelope with independent curve controls per stage, $MODULES.SimpleEnvelope$ -- lighter two-stage envelope when Hold, Decay, and curve shaping are not needed, $MODULES.TableEnvelope$ -- table-driven envelope shapes with separate attack and release curves, $UI.FloatingTiles.AHDSRGraph$ -- FloatingTile for displaying the envelope shape with animated playback position
