  ChannelFilter (MidiProcessor)

  Filters MIDI events by channel number. Has two mutually exclusive modes determined by the global MPE state:
  - Single-channel mode (MPE off): only events on the selected channel pass through.
  - MPE range mode (MPE on): events on channels within the start-end range pass through. Channel 1 (MPE master) is always allowed.

  Matching events pass unchanged - no remapping or transformation. Non-matching events are silently skipped by downstream processors.

  Filtered event types: noteOn, noteOff, CC, pitch bend, aftertouch.
  Unfiltered (always pass): transport events, internal events.

  CPU: negligible. Simple integer/bit comparisons per MIDI event.

  Parameters:
    channelNumber (1-16, default 1) - MIDI channel to allow when MPE is disabled
    mpeStart (2-16, default 2) - first channel in the MPE range when MPE is enabled
    mpeEnd (2-16, default 16) - last channel in the MPE range when MPE is enabled

  Common mistakes:
    Setting mpeStart > mpeEnd produces an empty range (only channel 1 passes).
    Transport events are not filtered.

![Channel Filter screenshot](/images/v2/reference/audio-modules/channelfilter.png)

The Channel Filter passes or blocks incoming MIDI events based on their channel number. It operates in two mutually exclusive modes determined by the global MPE state: single-channel mode (when MPE is off) allows only one selected channel, while MPE range mode (when MPE is on) allows a configurable range of channels plus the MPE master channel (channel 1).

Events that pass the filter continue unchanged - no channel remapping or transformation occurs. Non-matching events are silently skipped by downstream processors.

## Notes

The active mode is determined by the global MPE enabled state, not by a parameter on the module itself. When MPE is enabled system-wide, the Channel Filter switches to range mode automatically.

In MPE range mode, channel 1 (the MPE master channel) is always allowed through the filter.

The filter applies to note-on, note-off, CC, pitch bend, and aftertouch events. Transport events (song position, MIDI start, MIDI stop) and internal events pass through unconditionally.

If `mpeStart` is set higher than `mpeEnd`, the range is empty and only channel 1 passes through in MPE mode.
