  Midi Controller (Modulator/TimeVariantModulator)

  Converts MIDI CC, pitch wheel, or aftertouch messages into a monophonic modulation signal (0-1). An optional lookup table shapes the response curve, and a one-pole smoother prevents zipper noise.

  Signal flow:
    MIDI event -> normalise to 0-1 -> [table lookup] -> [invert] -> smooth -> modulation out

  CPU: low, monophonic (one shared value, not per-voice)

  Parameters:
    Inverted (Off/On, default Off) - flips the output: 1 - value
    UseTable (Off/On, default Off) - enables a curve editor for custom response shaping
    ControllerNumber (0-129, default 1) - which MIDI source to listen to: 0-127 for CC, 128 for pitch wheel, 129 for aftertouch
    SmoothTime (0-2000 ms, default 200 ms) - one-pole low-pass smoothing time; 0 disables smoothing
    DefaultValue (0-100%, default 0%) - initial output value applied at preset load

  When to use:
    Map any MIDI CC to a modulation target (filter cutoff, volume, FX mix). Use when you need smooth, table-shaped CC response. For pitch bend specifically, the dedicated PitchWheel modulator may be more convenient.

  Common mistakes:
    ControllerNumber 128 is pitch wheel and 129 is aftertouch (not the reverse).
    DefaultValue only applies at initial load, not on note-off or all-notes-off.

  Custom equivalent:
    hisescript via ScriptTimeVariantModulator: handle CC in onController and write values manually.

![Midi Controller screenshot](/images/v2/reference/audio-modules/midicontroller.png)

The Midi Controller modulator converts incoming MIDI CC messages into a monophonic modulation signal between 0 and 1. It is the standard way to map hardware knobs, faders, and pedals to any modulatable parameter in the signal chain. The raw 7-bit CC value is normalised, optionally shaped through a lookup table, and smoothed to prevent zipper noise on rapid changes.

Beyond standard CCs (0-127), the modulator can also respond to pitch wheel (ControllerNumber 128, 14-bit resolution) and aftertouch (ControllerNumber 129, including both channel pressure and polyphonic aftertouch). Because it is monophonic, a single smoothed value is shared across all voices.

### Aftertouch Aggregation

When ControllerNumber is set to 129 (aftertouch), the modulator accepts both channel pressure and polyphonic aftertouch messages. For polyphonic aftertouch, each note's pressure value is tracked independently, and the modulator outputs the **maximum** pressure across all currently held notes. When a note is released, its pressure value is cleared. This means the output always reflects the highest finger pressure rather than any single voice's aftertouch.

### Scripting Integration

To drive a Midi Controller modulator from script, use [Synth.sendController]($API.Synth.sendController$) with the matching CC number. This sends an internal controller message that the modulator responds to as if it came from external MIDI hardware. This is useful for connecting UI sliders to modulation targets without bypassing the smoothing and table processing.

> [!Tip:Use Synth.sendController for scripted CC values] Rather than setting the modulation value directly, send a controller message via `Synth.sendController(ccNumber, value)` so the value passes through the full signal path including table lookup and smoothing.

### MPE Behaviour

When MPE mode is enabled globally, the Midi Controller modulator only responds to events on MIDI channel 1 (the MPE master channel). Per-note expression channels are filtered out to avoid interference with MPE voice-level modulation.
