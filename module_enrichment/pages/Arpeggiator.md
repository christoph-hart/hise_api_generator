commonMistakes:
  - title: "Stride and Direction control different things"
    wrong: "Assuming Stride and Direction control the same thing"
    right: "Stride advances the slider pack step position; Direction selects which note from the held-key list is played"
    explanation: "These two controls advance independently. Stride determines which slider pack step provides the semitone offset, velocity, and length. Direction determines which note from the expanded sequence is played. Setting them to different values creates polyrhythmic patterns."
  - title: "100% length requires EnableTieNotes enabled"
    wrong: "Setting note length to 100% and expecting tied notes without enabling EnableTieNotes"
    right: "Turn EnableTieNotes on for 100% length steps to tie into the next step"
    explanation: "A length of 100% without EnableTieNotes simply plays a note for the full step duration. Tie behaviour requires both EnableTieNotes on and the step's length at exactly 100%."
  - title: "Hold persists until manually disabled"
    wrong: "Expecting Hold to release notes when new notes are played"
    right: "Hold keeps all notes until the Hold toggle is switched off"
    explanation: "Activating Hold latches all held notes. Releasing keys does not remove them from the sequence. Deactivating Hold removes all latched notes at once; if no physical keys remain held, the arpeggiator stops."

  Arpeggiator (MidiProcessor)

  A tempo-synced MIDI note sequencer. Captures held notes and plays them back as an arpeggiated pattern driven by a timer synchronised to host tempo. Three slider packs provide per-step control over semitone offset, velocity, and note length.

  Signal flow:
    MIDI notes in -> capture held keys -> [timer tick] -> select note by Direction -> apply slider pack data (semitone, velocity, length) -> generate artificial note -> MIDI out

  CPU: negligible (event-driven, no per-sample processing), monophonic.

  Parameters:
    Bypass (On/Off, default Off) - bypasses the arpeggiator, passing notes through unchanged
    Tempo (note values 1/1 to 1/64T, default 1/16) - step rate synced to host tempo
    NumSteps (1 - 32, default 4) - number of active steps in the slider packs
    Stride (-16 - 16, default 1) - slider pack step increment per tick
    StepReset (0 - 64, default 0) - resets sequence after N master steps (0 = disabled)
    Shuffle (0.0 - 1.0, default 0.0) - swing amount, alternates even/odd step timing
    CurrentStep (1 - 32) - current step position (read-write, 1-indexed)
    Direction (Up, Down, Up-Down, Down-Up, Random, Chord; default Up) - note traversal mode
    OctaveRange (-4 - 4, default 0) - extends the note sequence across octaves
    SortKeys (On/Off, default Off) - sorts held keys by pitch instead of input order
    Hold (On/Off, default Off) - latches notes after key release
    EnableTieNotes (On/Off, default Off) - allows 100% length steps to sustain into next step
    InputChannel (0 - 16, default 0) - input MIDI channel filter (0 = all)
    OutputChannel (0 - 16, default 0) - output MIDI channel (0 = use input channel)
    MPEStartChannel (2 - 16, default 2) - MPE zone start channel
    MPEEndChannel (2 - 16, default 16) - MPE zone end channel

  Slider Packs (SliderPackProcessor, 3 packs):
    Index 0 - SemiTone: per-step semitone offset (-24 to +24, default 0)
    Index 1 - Velocity: per-step velocity (1 to 127, default 127)
    Index 2 - Length: per-step note length as % of step duration (0 to 100, default 75; 0 = skip step, 100 = tie when enabled)

  When to use:
    Standard arpeggiation, sequenced patterns, chord strumming. Use Direction modes for traversal variety. Combine Stride with NumSteps to create polyrhythmic step patterns where the note selection and slider pack position cycle at different rates.

  Gotchas:
    Arp-generated notes are artificial events, invisible to sibling MIDI processors in the same chain. Place the arp in a parent container so child processors can see its output.
    Preset loading sends allNotesOff and stops the arp. Store/retrigger notes manually to maintain a pattern across preset changes.
    The arp timer does not stop when DAW transport stops; it runs as long as notes are held.
    Tempo parameter has extended divisions when compiled with HISE_USE_EXTENDED_TEMPO_VALUES=1.
    Hold can be driven by sustain pedal via setAttribute in onController callback (CC64).

  Common mistakes:
    Stride vs Direction confusion: they advance independently (Stride = slider pack position, Direction = note selection).
    Tie notes require both EnableTieNotes on AND length at exactly 100%.
    Hold latches all notes until toggled off, not until next note-on.

![Arpeggiator screenshot](/images/v2/reference/audio-modules/arpeggiator.png)

The Arpeggiator is a tempo-synced MIDI note sequencer. It captures incoming notes into a held-key list, then generates new note events on a timer synchronised to the host tempo. The original notes are consumed and replaced by the arpeggiated output. Six direction modes control how notes are traversed (Up, Down, Up-Down, Down-Up, Random, Chord), and the sequence can be extended across multiple octaves.

Three slider packs provide per-step control over semitone offset, velocity, and note length, accessed through the SliderPackProcessor interface. The note traversal index and the slider pack step position advance independently, so setting different sequence lengths or stride values creates polyrhythmic patterns. Steps can be skipped (length at 0%) or tied into the next step (length at 100% with EnableTieNotes on).

### Polyrhythmic Patterns

The note traversal index and the slider pack step position are independent counters. The note index advances by the Direction mode increment, while the step position advances by Stride. When the held-key count and NumSteps differ, or when Stride is not 1, these two counters cycle at different rates, producing polyrhythmic patterns.

### Slider Packs

The three slider packs (semitone offset, velocity, and note length) are accessed through the SliderPackProcessor interface as complex data indices 0, 1, and 2. The semitone pack offsets the selected note by -24 to +24 semitones per step. The velocity pack sets the output velocity (1 to 127) per step. The length pack controls note duration as a percentage of the step interval, with two special values: 0% skips the step entirely, and 100% ties into the next step when EnableTieNotes is on.

### Chord Mode

In Chord mode, all notes in the expanded sequence are played simultaneously each step. Notes arriving within a short window of the chord onset are added to the current chord in real time. Chord mode always uses pitch-sorted order regardless of the SortKeys setting.

### Placement

Notes generated by the Arpeggiator are marked as artificial events and are not visible to sibling MIDI processors in the same chain. To process arp-generated notes in a downstream script, place the Arpeggiator in a parent container's MIDI chain so that child sound generators' MIDI processors can see the output.

### Limitations

The maximum step rate is limited to approximately 25 steps per second (40 ms minimum timer interval), regardless of host tempo.

The arpeggiator timer does not respond to DAW transport - it continues running as long as notes are held, even when the host is stopped. Use a TransportHandler to detect stop events and release held notes if transport-aware behaviour is needed.

Loading a user preset sends an all-notes-off message that stops the arpeggiator. To maintain a running pattern across preset changes, store the held note state before loading and retrigger the notes after the preset has loaded.

### MPE

In MPE mode, generated notes carry the per-channel gesture data (pressure, slide, glide) captured from the original input, preserving expressive control through the arpeggiator.
