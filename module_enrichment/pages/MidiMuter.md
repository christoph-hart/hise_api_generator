  MidiMuter (MidiProcessor)

  Selectively blocks note-on and note-off events based on a mute toggle. Non-note MIDI messages (CC, pitch bend, aftertouch, program change) always pass through unmodified.

  Signal flow:
    MIDI in -> [dispatch by event type] -> note-on: block if muted -> note-off: block if muted (unless fixStuckNotes + note was previously heard) -> all else: passthrough -> MIDI out

  CPU: negligible (boolean checks and single-bit operations per event), monophonic.

  Parameters:
    ignoreButton (Off/On, default Off) - mute toggle; when on, blocks note-on events
    fixStuckNotes (Off/On, default Off) - when on, allows note-offs for previously-heard notes to pass through during mute

  Tracks which note numbers have been heard using a 128-bit tracker (one bit per note number), updated regardless of mute state. This ensures accurate tracking when mute is first engaged.

  When to use:
    Muting a sound generator's MIDI input without removing it from the signal chain. Useful for A/B switching, layered instrument muting, or live performance mute groups.

  Common mistakes:
    Enable fixStuckNotes before engaging the mute if notes may be sounding - otherwise note-offs are blocked and notes get stuck.
    Held keys do not retroactively sound when the mute is disengaged - the key must be re-pressed.

MidiMuter selectively blocks note events based on a mute toggle. When the mute is engaged, note-on events are blocked, preventing new notes from sounding. Note-off events are also blocked by default, but the fixStuckNotes parameter can allow note-offs through for notes that were already sounding before the mute was engaged. All non-note MIDI messages (CC, pitch bend, aftertouch, program change) always pass through unmodified.

The module tracks which note numbers have been heard using a 128-bit tracker that is updated continuously, regardless of mute state. This means the tracker already has an accurate picture of which notes are sounding at the moment the mute is engaged, so fixStuckNotes can immediately allow the correct note-offs through.

## Notes

With ignoreButton on and fixStuckNotes off, both note-on and note-off events are blocked. This will cause stuck notes if any notes were sounding when the mute was engaged. Enable fixStuckNotes to avoid this.

The module does not send artificial note-off or note-on events when the mute is toggled. When the mute is engaged, currently sounding notes continue until their note-offs arrive (handled by fixStuckNotes). When the mute is disengaged, keys that were held during the muted period do not retroactively trigger - the key must be released and pressed again.

The note tracker uses one bit per note number (0-127), not one bit per voice. If the same note number is triggered multiple times, only one bit is tracked. This is consistent with standard MIDI note-off matching by note number.
