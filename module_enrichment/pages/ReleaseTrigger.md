  ReleaseTrigger (MidiProcessor)

  Converts noteOff events into noteOn events for release-triggered sample layers. Consumes all incoming noteOn and noteOff events, then generates a new artificial noteOn on each key release using the original noteOn's velocity.

  Signal flow:
    noteOn in -> store velocity + timestamp, consume original
    noteOff in -> consume original -> [optional: time-based velocity attenuation] -> inject artificial noteOn

  CPU: negligible (event-driven, no per-sample processing).

  Parameters:
    TimeAttenuate (Off/On, default Off) - enables time-based velocity attenuation
    Time (0-20 s, default 0 s) - normalisation window for hold-time attenuation
    TimeTable (table curve) - maps normalised hold time (0-1) to velocity multiplier (0-1)

  Interfaces: TableProcessor (one table: TimeTable attenuation curve)

  When to use:
    Triggering release samples (key-up layers) in a sampler instrument. Place it in a dedicated sound generator's MIDI chain so that only the release group receives the converted events.

  Key behaviours:
    - Both original noteOn and noteOff are consumed (ignored) - nothing passes through unchanged.
    - With TimeAttenuate on, longer key holds produce quieter release samples (shaped by the table curve).
    - With TimeAttenuate off, release velocity equals the original noteOn velocity.
    - MPE mode switches velocity source from the original noteOn to the noteOff velocity.
    - If attenuated velocity reaches 0, no release noteOn is generated (silent drop).

  Common mistakes:
    - Expecting originals to pass through: both noteOn and noteOff are consumed.
    - Time = 0 with TimeAttenuate on makes attenuation maximally aggressive - use Off to disable.

  Tips:
    - Release samples need a dedicated second sampler; they cannot share a sampler with sustain layers.
    - The Time parameter is in seconds despite the slider showing 'ms'.
    - The built-in module does not handle sustain pedal (CC64); use a custom ScriptProcessor for pedal-aware release behaviour.
    - MPE mode switches velocity source to noteOff velocity and can disrupt normal release triggering.

![ReleaseTrigger screenshot](/images/v2/reference/audio-modules/releasetrigger.png)

The ReleaseTrigger converts noteOff events into noteOn events for release-triggered sample layers. It consumes all incoming noteOn and noteOff events, storing each noteOn's velocity and timestamp indexed by note number. When a key is released, it generates a new artificial noteOn using the stored velocity and injects it into the MIDI chain. This makes downstream sound generators play their samples on key release rather than key press.

An optional time-based velocity attenuation feature scales the release velocity according to how long the key was held. A table curve defines the attenuation shape: short holds can produce full-velocity releases whilst long holds fade to silence (or any other curve shape). When attenuation is disabled, the original noteOn velocity passes through at full strength. In MPE mode, the velocity source switches from the original noteOn velocity to the noteOff velocity.

### Dedicated Sampler Requirement

Release-triggered sample layers cannot share a single Sampler with normal sustain samples. Use two separate Sampler modules: one for normal notes and one for release-triggered notes, with the ReleaseTrigger on the second sampler's MIDI chain [1](https://forum.hise.audio/topic/4225). Both the original noteOn and noteOff events are consumed by this module -- nothing passes through unchanged -- so it must not be placed on a sustain layer's chain.

### Sustain Pedal Behaviour

The built-in ReleaseTrigger does not handle MIDI CC64 (sustain pedal): release samples fire immediately on key-up even when the pedal is held [1](https://forum.hise.audio/topic/13205). For instruments that need pedal-aware release behaviour, a custom ScriptProcessor implementation that tracks pedal state and defers release sample playback until pedal release is the recommended approach.

### MPE Mode

In MPE mode, the velocity source switches from the original noteOn velocity to the noteOff velocity. Enabling MPE can disrupt release trigger behaviour in some configurations; if problems occur, keep MPE disabled by default and only enable it when explicitly needed [1](https://forum.hise.audio/topic/11871).

### Overlapping Notes

The module tracks incoming noteOn events per MIDI note number using a 128-slot array. If the same note number fires a second noteOn before the first noteOff (e.g. from MPE or layered instruments), the first noteOn's velocity and timestamp are silently overwritten -- only the most recent noteOn for a given note number is retained.

### Velocity Gate

When the attenuated velocity rounds down to 0, no release noteOn is generated. This is expected behaviour -- the table curve can be shaped to intentionally silence releases beyond a certain hold duration.
