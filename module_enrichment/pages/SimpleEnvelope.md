  Simple Envelope (Modulator/EnvelopeModulator)

  A lightweight two-stage (attack + release) envelope with an implicit sustain at full level (1.0). Lighter than AHDSR due to SIMD-optimised sustain/idle states and a simpler state machine.

  Signal flow:
    noteOn -> [attack mod chain] -> attack ramp (0 to 1) -> sustain (hold at 1.0) -> noteOff -> release ramp (1 to 0) -> idle

  CPU: low, polyphonic (SIMD fast-path during sustain and idle)

  Parameters:
    Attack (0-20000 ms, default 5 ms) - attack ramp time, modulatable per voice via the Attack Time Modulation chain
    Release (0-20000 ms, default 10 ms) - release ramp time, shared across all voices (not modulatable)
    LinearMode (Off/On, default On) - On: straight-line ramps; Off: exponential curves (steeper initial release, longer tail)
    Monophonic (Off/On, default dynamic) - all voices share a single envelope state
    Retrigger (Off/On, default On) - in monophonic mode, new notes restart the envelope from the current value

  Modulation chains:
    AttackTimeModulation - scales the attack time per voice at note-on (VoiceStartModulator only)

  When to use:
    Volume shaping where only attack and release matter. Ideal for pads, risers, or any patch where sustain is always at full level. Use AHDSR when you need adjustable sustain or decay stages.

  Common mistakes:
    Sustain is always 1.0 - there is no sustain level parameter.
    Changing Release affects all currently releasing voices (shared coefficient).
    Artificial notes from Synth.playNote() need Synth.noteOffByEventId() to trigger release.
    No loop stage - use scriptnode for looping envelopes.

  Custom equivalent:
    hisescript via ScriptEnvelopeModulator: implement attack/release ramps in onVoiceStart/onVoiceStop.

![Simple Envelope screenshot](/images/v2/reference/audio-modules/simpleenvelope.png)

The Simple Envelope is a lightweight two-stage envelope modulator with attack and release. The sustain level is fixed at 1.0 (full output) - there is no decay, adjustable sustain, or loop stage. The sustain and idle states skip per-sample processing entirely, making this the most CPU-efficient envelope in HISE at high voice counts. For looping envelope behaviour, use a scriptnode network instead.

Both stages support linear or exponential curves via the **LinearMode** toggle. Linear mode produces straight-line ramps. Exponential mode produces a curved attack (moderate curvature) and a classic exponential release with a steep initial drop followed by a long tail, cutting off at approximately -80 dB. The attack time can be modulated per voice through the Attack Time Modulation chain; the release time is shared across all voices.

### Artificial Notes and Release

> [!Tip:Store event IDs for artificial notes] When triggering notes with `Synth.playNote()`, store the returned event ID (e.g. in a [MIDIList]($API.MIDIList$)) and call `Synth.noteOffByEventId()` to ensure the release stage fires. Without an explicit note-off, the envelope remains in sustain indefinitely.
